This is well captured by his spiri­ textbooks. David Frawley's entire thinking and life revolve around Indic culture and spirituali ty, and whenever I ask him any ques­ spring. Since the early 1980s, he has made his insights into Indias magnificent spiritual and medical traditions available to West­ This new book highlights the close connection between Yoga and Ayurveda, both of which are fundamental holistic disciplin es. They intersect in the concept of somatic and psychospiritual wholeness. Yoga focuses on spiritual integration through self­ on psychosomatic integration through comprehensive health care One of the hallmarks of Yoga is balance, and thus practitio­ ners of this ancient art and science must pay proper attention to thusiasts seek to cultivate meditation and higher states of con­ sciousness apart from the physical body, but the body is the ground for realizing enlightenm ent. If we don't take care of the body, it is likely to succumb to illness sooner or later. Remem­ one of the obstacles to successful completion of the yogic pro­ cess. If you question this, try meditating with a toothache or Yoga and Ayurveda while feeling sick to your stomach. It can be done, of course, but it presupposes considerable skill in concentration. Somatic imbalances readily give rise to mental disturbanc es, and vice versa. Theref ore, cultivating a trong, healthy body and training the mind should go hand in hand, and both pursuits should Both Yoga and Ayurveda are enjoying immense popularity in the West at the moment. But both disCiplines are also subject to considerable distortion. David Frawley's new book could not have been more timely It offers a most valuable overview of the con­ necting points between Yoga and Ayurveda and shows how both disciplines are relevant to contemporary spiritual practice. In particular, this book contains many helpful practical point­ ers, which will help you to understand your constitutional type in Ayurvedic terms. This? in turn, will assist you in chOOSing the right kind of yogic postural or meditation practice. The yogic path is intrinsically challenging, and wise practitioners welcome any in­ formation that will benefit them even a little bit. Thus the typo­ Yoga. If you make little progress on the yogic path, it is perhaps because you are on the wrong track. Understanding your constitu­ tional type is important not only when determining your diet or a course of medical treatment but also when embarking on spiritual practice. All tracks are equally good and serviceab le, but you must have the right axle width to fit on a given track and reach your destination smoothly and safely , or at all. If you have arrived at the Georg Feuerstein, Ph. D., Director, Yoga Research Center The Shamballa Guide to Yoga, Tantra: The Path of Ecstasy, etc. Yoga and Ayurveda sacred sciences rooted in the Vedic tradition of India. Ayurveda is the Vedic science of healing for both body developed together and have always been used together. There­ fore, those who are interested in one would benefit from study­ ing the other. However, most books on yoga in the West speak little of Ayurveda. Though all ayurvedic books speak of yoga, so far there has been no single book on Ayurveda and yoga pub­ Yoga and Ayurveda are far more than physical exercise or bodily healing systems such as we tend to view them today, however important these aspects may be. Both classical yoga and Ayurveda look to the whole human being, which is not higher consciousne ss. Therefore, I have oriented this book to the broader view that could be called \"integral yoga\" and \"inte­ gral Ayurveda.\" This is traditionally called pancha kosha yoga and pancha kosha Ayurveda, meaning yoga and Ayurveda of the five sheaths, which refers to the physical body, prana, mind, intelligence, and soul as well as our higher Self. It is also de­ Yoga and Ayurveda addresses our entire nature, our greater life as a spiritual and cosmic being. It examines the broader scope of Ayurveda, which includes not only physical health but Yoga and Ayurveda also mental health and preparation for the spiritual life. Simi­ larly it looks into the entire field of yoga, the science of raja yoga and its eight limbs, from asana to meditation. While the present book does examine the subject of asana in one major chapter, a more thorough investigation of the topic is planned The book is meant for those who want to explore a deeper level of knowledge than what is usually described in introduc­ tory books on these subjects, which are commonly available. It discusses many details about the subtle and causal bodies and their ene rgetics, including much information not previously in print in English. This includes topics such as the seven agnis, the three vital essences of prana, tejas and ojas, the nadis and chakras, as well as practical methods to unfold these energies. It The present book is deSigned to complement my last book in this field, Ayurveda and the Mind, which deals with the psy­ chological aspects and the view of the mind in yoga and Ayurveda. Ayurveda and the Mind contains relevant information on mantra and other yogic practices that is not repeated in the present vol­ ume and is helpful for those who want more information in these areas. Yoga and Ayurveda also interfaces with Tantric Yoga and the Wisdom Goddesses: Spiritual Secrets of Ayurveda, which provides additional information on the subtle body and deity",

Ayurveda is one of the most remarkable holistic medical sys­ ods of healing from diet, herbs, exercise and lifestyle regimens to yogic practices and meditation. With its unique understand­ ing of individual constitution, Ayurveda provides the inSight for each person and each culture to create a way of life in harmony both with the world of nature and our higher Self.

Ayurveda contains the secrets not only for healing the individual but also for uplifting society, all creatures and the planet itself. Yoga and Ayurveda are sister sciences that developed together and repeatedly influenced each other throughout history They are integral parts of the great system of Vedic knowledge which states that all the universe is One Self and that the key to cos­ mic knowledge lies within our own minds and hearts. As Vedic disciplines, yoga and Ayurveda work together to enhance their great benefits on all levels. They can be integrated with related Vedic or yogic sciences of astrology, architecture, music and lan­ concern is spiritual practice, mainly through meditation, to take us beyond the sorrow and ignorance of the world. It teaches us our immortal Self that dwells within the heart. Yoga provides the key to all spiritual development, which in the Vedic sense is gaining knowledge of our true nature beyond time, space, death lieving the diseases of body and mind. This does not mean that Ayurveda is merely a method of personal healing which doesn't require help from therapists or doctors. In fact, Ayurveda says that medical practitioners are indispensable in dealing with the complexities of disease and the variabilities of health require­ restoring wholeness, with our inner Self as its ultimate goal, which Ayurveda's concern is alleviating both bodily and mental diseases and promoting both physical and psychological well­ being. Yet the ultimate goal of classical Ayurveda, like classical 6 Yoga and Ayurveda shows us how to attain optimal health not for outer enjoyment but to provide a wholesome foundation and sufficient energy to The link between yoga and Ayurveda is prana, or the life­ force. Yoga is the intelligence of prana seeking greater evolu­ tionary transformations, while Ayurveda is its healing power, Together, Ayurveda and yoga afford a complete discipline , one which can transform our existence from the physical to the deepest spiritual levels of our being with extraordinary vitality and cre­ Yoga is a common term in the Western world today, where yoga classes can be found in every city or neighbor hood. Most people identify yoga with the physical postures or asanas that are the most evident side of the system. While yoga asanas can afford a good doorway into the vast temple of yoga, they are hardly the entire structure or its central deity. Eventually, most who look into yoga will come into contact with its broader and more spiritual practices, such as mantra and meditation. Ayurveda is Similarly becoming known in the West today as a special system of natural medicine. There are ayurvedic cen­ ters in most cities in the country. Ayurvedic herbs can be found at most health food stores. The idea of ayurvedic constitutional types has been presented in a number of popular books and magazine s. However, the physical side of ayurvedic healing through diet and herbs is only part of the system. Its inner as­ A number of yoga centers offer ayurvedic therapies and the two sciences are generally studied together. However, many people who have been introduced to yoga from a physical model may not be fully aware of the importance of its ayurvedic connec­ tion. This may include various yoga teachers and yoga thera­ pists, who may themselves have no ayurvedic training. Traditionally, in India, yoga dealt with the spiritual side of Ayurveda, on the other hand, dealt with both physical and men­ tal disease as well as with the prescription of lifestyle regimens . Yoga as therapy or exercise was traditionally prescribed in an ayurvedic context. Classical yoga therapy was ayurvedic both in theory and in applicatio n. This fact should be borne in mind by those using yoga today for healing purposes. They should not ignore the potential benefits of adding ayurvedic insights to yoga therapy. They should learn to understand the ayurvedic effects of yogic practices and not merely try to define yogic healing in terms of modern medicine or modern psychology alone. The combined study of yoga and Ayurveda is of great im­ portance for each discipline and for helping us understand the whole of life that both sciences address in such a profound manner. Restoring wholeness in body, mind and spirit is what we are all seeking, both individually and collectively. , j. All the great spiritual and healing traditions of the Indian subcontinent are based upon the concept of dharma or natural law. Dharma is a Sanskrit word that refers to the laws of truth that govern the universe . Dharma is that which upholds things, a fundamental principle , and literally a pillar. Dharmas are the underlying principles that keep all things in harmony and sus­ tain their higher growth and development. Such dharmic prin­ Ciples, like physical laws, must be the same for all beings. Dharma indicates the foundation of universal law on which we must base our actions for them to gain the support of the universe . Hindu­ ism calls itself Sanatana Dharma, or the Eternal Dharma, sug­ gesting a tradition of natural law not limited by time, space or person. Buddhism calls itself Buddha Dharma, the natural way Yoga can be called dharmic spiritual practice, Yoga Dharma. Yoga is a dharmic approach to the spiritual life, which is the which is to give up outer seeking and strive to know our true nature. All the methodolog ies of yoga are dharmic in nature, helping us harness natural law and the spiritual forces in nature to transform our consciousness from ignorance to enlightenment. Ayurveda can be called dharmic medicine . Ayurveda repre­ sents a dharmic approach to health and everyday living natural healing based upon natural law, conscious healing follOwing the laws of consciousne ss. Ayurveda is the science of health based upon dharmic prinCiple s, which seeks to uphold the dharma both in treatment and in its lifestyle regimens. Dharmic living gives us health and happiness, putting us in contact with cos­ mic forces of beneficence. Adharmic living, life contrary to dharma, brings pain and disharmony to all. A dharmic life is the basis of all ayurvedic treatment and all ayurvedic lifestyle regimens. Most psychological problems and emotional disorders are rooted in adharmic living, living out of harmony with the universe. Most The most important dharmic law is the law of karma: as we act, so must we experience the fruit of our actions, not only in this life but in future lives as well. There is an absolute justice in the universe , but this occurs through many incarnations and cannot be seen by a momentary look at human affairs. It is not a justice of outer rewards and punishments but one of the de­ velopment of consciousness. Dhannic action provides inner peace and happiness and allows us to pursue spiritual practice. Adharmic action constricts our consciousness and consigns us to darkness and turbulence of mind, though it may give us transient exter­ The most important ethical dharma, sometimes called the mind that does not wish injury to any creature, not merely for human beings, but for plants, animals and the entire natural order. For it to be complete, ahimsa must extend not only to Ahimsa is the most important observance in the practice of yoga and the basis for mental peace, which is not possible if we harbor thoughts of harm for others. How can we sincerely en­ gage in spiritual practices if we are engaged in actions that are violent, destructive , deceptive or manipulative? Ahimsa is the basis of the ayurvedic approach to health and the support of all and a lifestyle that does not project harm onto other creatures . Ahimsa is behind the ayurvedic recommendation of a veg­ etarian diet, but it extends to all ayurvedic healing prescrip­ tions. Food should not be based upon cruelty. Food, after all, is a means of providing nourishment. What kind of nourishment can be derived from food that reflects not the energy of love but that of exploitation? Our occupation or vocation in life should also follow an energy of love and not be harmful to other crea­ tures. Unfortunate ly, modern culture is built upon competition and wasteful consumption in which there is great harm not only Above all, medicines should be not be based upon cruelty. Modern medicine believes that by causing harm to other crea­ tures, as in animal testing, we can gain benefits for healing people. Ayurveda states that this is a false logic. We cannot alleviate suffering for one creature by causing suffering to another more helpless. Suffering begets suf fering. On the contrary, caring for other creatures benefits our own health, even if it means plac­ ing the greater good of all creatures above the good of our own particular species. We cannot triumph in life or wisdom at the Ahimsa is the main principle of mental health because it removes the basis for negative emotions to flourish in the mind. It is the main principle of social health because it cuts off the root of social conflict, which is violence stemming from hatred, anger and resentment. Ahimsa, however, is not simply passivity or resignation. Sometimes we must act in a strong or decisive way to prevent harm from occurring, as in the action of a true warrior and defender of dharma. To protect others is another aspect of ahimsa, not often properly understo od. It is the basis of the Kshatriya Dharma, the Vedic way of the warrior or heroic spirit. For this reason Ayurveda accepts strong therapies, like Both yoga and Ayurveda teach that we should pray or chant daily universal prayers for peace that project this power of non­ Ayurveda shares the dharmic principles of yoga, the yamas and niyamas, which are important prinCiples of right living, that we will discuss under the Paths of Yoga. In addition to univer­ sal dharmas, each individual has his or her own personal dharma, or svadharma, the law of our own particular nature that shows us our speCial role and purpose in life. Yoga requires that we find the appropriate dharmic spiritual path and understand our place in the universal unfoldment of consciousness. Ayurveda states that health depends upon discovering our individual dharma and living in harmony with it. In this regard the diet, medicine , life circumstanc es, and spiritual practices that may be dharmic for one person may not be right for another. This prin­ ciple of svadharma underlies Ayurveda's emphasis upon consti­ tutional types and individualized lifestyle regimens and yoga's idea of an individualized or personalized practice. On this dharmic foundation, let us examine the spiritual, philosophical and cos­ mological background behind these two great systems. All dharmas are ultimately one in the Supreme Dharma, which is the unity of all existence. There is one Absolute Truth behind the universe, an eternal, infinite and immutable Reality called Brahman. Brahman means the Vast, or that which carries everything, and is the basis of all dharmic principles. Brahman is the underlying substance of existence , both manifest and unmanif est, which is not material but spiritual. We all arise from Brahman, abide in it, and must eventually return to it. All the endless and innumerable universes are nothing but waves",

Consciousness is the ultimate principle behind the universe, which in its marvelous order reflects the workings of a supreme intelligence. Pure consciousness is the source of all subjectivity or sense of self through which we feel alive and can act inde­ pendently. We all feel ourselves as conscious individuals and not as mere objects or instruments . This is our connection with the Purusha within us, also called the Atman or higher Self. The outer world exists to provide experience for the Purusha. able phenomenon that cannot exist for its own sake but only for that of its perceiver. The world is based on intelligen ce; it works through the mind and follows a pattern of organic law reflecting However, this higher Self is distinct from the ego, or the \"I am the body\" idea, which in Samkhya is called ahamkara or the It is neither body nor mind, which are interrelated parts of mat­ ate, which is not limited by them. The Purusha is the substra­ tum or conscious ground of all manifestation which shines by his reflected light. Its light, mirrored through the mind, allows While the Purusha is figuratively called \"he\", we must re­ member that it contains its own Shakti or power of vision as its feminine aspect. As a conscious subject we cannot call the Purusha \"it\", although it is not limited by gender or any other external distinctions as it is beyond all form. The goal of yoga is the same as Samkhya, to return to the consciousness of the Purusha. The goal of Ayurveda is to connect our bodies and minds with The ultimate healing power and the original prana come from God, the Cosmic Lord and Creator, is called Ishvara in San­ skrit. lshvara is the power that creates, sustains and destroys the world through the three forms of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva and their feminine powers of Sarasvati, Lakshmi and Kali. lshvara works to guide the worlds, oversees the workings of the law of karma, and aids all souls in their evolution from ignorance to While lshvara is a concept similar to God in Western, cul­ ture it should be noted that lshvara works through various gods and goddesses as the One Creator has many diverse and specific forms. lshvara has many different names, functions and lines of approach. lshvara can be worshipped in the feminine sense, Ishvan, the Divine Mother, which is the preferable form in many yogic paths, particularly those of a tantric nature. ciples of classical Samkhya. However, the yoga system which Dharma and Tattva 17 Ayurveda accepts introduces Ishvara as an additional cosmic principle , a special Purusha possessed of perfect intelligen ce.4 Ishvara is the original teacher or guru for all souls and the source of the spiritual teachings of the Vedas.5 Ayurveda recognizes God as the creator and guide, whom we should all look to for heal­ ing and gUidance .

We should note, however, that Prakriti is different than Brahman, which is the substance not only of the world of mani­ festation like Prakriti, but also of Pure Consciousness, the Purusha. Brahman is the being behind both Purusha and Prakriti, which are the powers of consciousness and unconsciousness inherent within it. For this reason, Brahman is sometimes spo­ ken of as Para Prakriti or the Supreme Nature, the immutable Prakriti means \"the first power of action\" and its qualities direct the entire cosmic movement. It provides the raw material out of which the different worlds and our bodies are built. It living creatures come into existence and forms the substratum of their minds. Prakriti therefore is also called the \"Unmanifest\" or Avyakta. It contains all that can be manifest in a dormant form. On the level of Prakriti, one can percei ve all beings and Like the mother of the world, which is born from its sub­ stance, Prakriti is often spoken of in the feminine tense. Prakriti and her manifestation exist to provide experience for the Purusha so that he can gain mastery over himself and come to an under­ standing of his true nature. She is like a mother who selflessly provides for her child and gives him challenges to help him grow. Ayurveda recognizes Prakriti as the basis of our embodi­ ment and experience on all levels. Each one of us has an indi­ vidual physical Prakriti or nature that consists of our bodily condition, and a mental Prakriti which is the condition of our Prakriti is composed of the three prime qualities of sattva, rajas and tamas, the qualities of light, energy and matter, through which it contains intelligen ce, life and the power to produce material forms.

At the beginning of creation, cosmic mind comes into being in order to create the world. It contains within itself all the laws and principles, the dharmas that the manifestation must follow. The universe first arises as a meditation of cosmic intelligence and only later takes on form externally. Mahat, or Cosmic Intelligence, therefore, is the manifest form of Prakriti or Prakriti in action. It is Prakriti molded by the will of God. Mahat literally means \"the great\" and refers to the great truth principles behind life. The realm of Mahat is that of the ideal creation that transcends time, the nominal as opposed to the phenomenal realm. Mahat is the Divine Mind. Through Mahat, space, time, the divine Word and the seeds of differentiation arise. It is the womb of all creation. Yet even Mahat, cosmic intelli­ gence, is not conscious in itself, but works through the reflected In the individual soul, Mahat becomes Buddhi, the power of intelligence through which we can discern truth from falsehood, right fTOm wrong, and the eternal from the transient. Buddhi is the key faculty of our nature through which we can discover the real nature of things as apart from their changing appearances. It is the intelligence of the individual soul.

      "description": "buddhi or intelligence so that we can learn how the mind and the body function in order to use them correctly In the ayurvedic view, the main cause of disease is wrong functioning of the buddhi owing to the influence of the ego, which results in bad judg­ ment, wrong values and false beliefs. Mahat and buddhi are the intelligent portion of the mind. Using the term \"mind\" in this sense, mind or intelligence is the origin of all the universe. All manifestation is a process of division through which sepa­ rate creatures and different objects come into being. To enable multiplicity to occur, cosmic creation works through various separate entities or individual identities which are the basis for process, not an intrinsic reality It is a series of divisive thoughts but not a real entity in itself. It is a necessary power of division inherent in nature, a stage in evolution, but does not represent the underlying truth or nature of creatures. It allows the soul to identify with different bodies, but does not reveal our true Self, take specific forms. Under the pointed focus of the ego, the ba­ sic qualities of Nature diversify into the three groups of five: five senses, five organs of action, and five elements. These arise from ahamkara through the three gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas. Ego creates the mind and senses, which are the instruments that allow the individual to function. Hence ego represents the out­ going aspect of the mind, while buddhi or intelligence is its internal aspect. However, buddhi remains under the dominance Under the influence of ego, the possibility of divergence from Dharma and Tattva 21 nature arises. Prakriti or the natural condition of things can become vikriti the diseased, disturbed, unnatural or artificial condition.

It is observable as an object and not the true source of consciousness. Our sensory perceptions are easy to see as ob­ jects, but we can also observe our emotions and thoughts, which means that these are Similarly outside our true Self. Even the ego can be observed, as when we look at our pride or fear, which shows that it also is an object and not our true Self, which is pure awareness only. Yoga shows us how to move from the mind and all of its involvement to this ever free inner Self. 6",

      "description": "Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, the qualities born of Nature Primal Nature, Prakriti, is not an homogenous substance but the seed ground of multiplicit y. She is like the tail of a peacock, which when withdrawn disappears into uniformity but when unfolded reveals all the colors of the rainbow. Prakriti holds in herself all the forms of creation which manifest through her three main qualities, the gunas of sattva, rajas and tamas. Rajas is the active, stimulating or positive force that initiates change, disturbing the old equilibrium. Tamas is the passive, obstructing or negative force which sustains previous activity. . Sattva is the neutral or balanCing force, harmonizing the posi­ tive and negative, which oversees and observes. All three forces are necessary in ordinary activity but have spiritual implications Sattva is the quality of light, love and life, the higher or spiritual force that allows us to evolve in consciousness. It im­ tion, the intermediate or vital force, which lacks stability or con­ sistency. It gives rise to emotional fluctuations of attraction and repulsion , fear and desire, love and hate . Tamas is the quality of which drags us down into the ignorance and attachment. It causes dullness, inertia, heaviness, emotional clinging and stagnation. Unmanifest Prakriti holds these three qualities in equilib­ rium, in which rajas and tamas are merged into sattva. In mani­ festation, the three qualities differentiate, with sattva giving rise form and substance through which the physical body comes into There are two basic laws of the gunas that are crucial in understanding their workings . The first law of the gunas is \"the law of alternation.\" The three gunas are ever in dynamic inter­ action. All three forces remain intertwin ed, affecting each other in various ways. Rajas and tamas exist in the field of sattva, tamas and sattva are found in the field of rajas, and sattva and rajas move in the field of tamas. The essence of the three quali­ ties is their interplay. We rarely see pure tamas, pure rajas or pure sattva. We must ever be ready for the gunas to change. The second law of the gunas is \"the law of continuit y.\" The gunas tend to hold their particular natures for a certain period once they come into dominance . Substances stabilize on the level of one of the three gunas. While it is initially is difficult for tamas to become rajas, or for rajas to become sattva, once they We can see these two laws in any movement of time. Night as darkness belongs to tamas, sunrise and sunset as transitional periods relate to rajas, and day as light corresponds to sattva. The Three Gunas and Mental Nature 29 These three phases must ever alternate . Night gives way to dawn, which in turn gives way to day, which in turn at dusk gives way However, once a particular phase is created, it will endure with little change for a period of time. The night continues on for some time before changing into the day, which in turn has its period of duration. During these respective periods certain conditions persist. For example , we are active throughout the In this regard tamas and sattva have more continuity than rajas. Rajas, which is inherently unstable, cannot hold its own condition for long and must revert to tamas or advance to sattva. Rajas is transitional and governs the interaction between the gunas. Nevertheless , it is possible for people to remain at the level of rajas as the dominant quality for most of their lives. This is the condition of modern society, which is predominantly rajasic, active and changeable . But for rajas to continue there must be ongoing As the gunas are relational conditions, we must remember that what is sattva on one level may become rajas or tamas rela­ tive to another. Anything that raises a person up in conscious­ ness is sattva for them. What brings them down is tamas. This means that the more we advance along the spiritual path, what was previously sattvic or helpful may have to be discarded as Yoga and Ayurveda emphasize the development of sattva. In yoga, sattva is the higher quality that allows spiritual growth to occur. In Ayurveda, sattva is the state of balance that makes healing Yoga practice has two stages: the development of sattva and the transcendence of sattva. Development of sattva means puri­ fication of body and mind. Transcendence of sattva means going beyond the body and mind to our true Self beyond manifesta­ tion. The general rule is that if one has not developed sattva, one cannot go beyond it. One should not forget this important rule. If we don't have the appropriate sattva or purity in our body and mind, including in our emotions, it may be premature for us to seek any higher enlightenment. Development of sattva occurs through right diet, physical purification, control of the senses, control of the mind, mantra and devotion . Transcendence Sattva is also the key to ayurvedic healing. Ayurveda states that the sattvic body and mind are less likely to suffer from disease and more able to continue in a state of balance. Disease, particular ly of a chronic nature, is a tamasic state. Tamas brings about the accumulation of toxins and waste materials on a phYSical level and of negative thoughts and emotions on a psychological level. Health is a sattvic state of balance and adaptation which prevents any excess from occurring. Rajas is the movement ei­ ther from health to disease or disease to health depending upon its direction of development. Acute diseases fall under rajas, which However, we must not forget the admixtures of the gunas. There is a higher rajas and tamas in the field of sattva and a lower sattva in the fields of rajas and tamas. Similarly there are rajasic aspects of tamas and tamasic aspects of rajas. The follow­ Rajasic Sattva: the active or transformative force of sattva, the power of spiritual aspiration that struggles upward, ever seeking greater growth and unfoldment. It is also any energy of healing Tamasic Sattva: the destructive force of sattva that eliminates negativity. It is also the stability inherent in sattva, its capacity to endure through all obstacles. It is the capacity of a state of balance to sustain itself and to ward off disease or imbalance. Sattvic Rajas: the type of religion, spirituality or idealism of rajasic people. It has rajasic traits of aggression, outer expansion and the seeking of power. Religions based upon militance, exclusivism Tamasic Rajas: the inertia of rajasic types, their resistance to any higher force, and holding to their own personal power and im­ pulses regardless of the consequences for themselves or others. Sattvic Tamas: the religion, spirituality or idealism of tamasic people. It has tamasic traits of destruction, darkness, and delu­ sion. It is the level of dark cults and superstitions. Rajasic Tamas: the aggression and violence of dull and ignorant people. It is perhaps the most destructive gunic quality. Tamasic types literally trample over others and, devoid of sensitivity, de­ light in harm and destruction. Deep sexual perversions come at The higher rajasic force or rajasic sattva is perhaps the key force both in spirituality and healing. The lower rajasic force is rajas leading to tamas, like the dusk moving into night, or au­ tumn becoming winter. The higher rajasic force is rajas leading to sattva, like the dawn creating the day, or spring moving into For spiritual growth this higher force of rajas is necessary It is the real shakti or transforming energy. Through it one be­ comes a spiritual warrior and can do spiritual practices with great energy and vigor. Yoga is not only about developing sattva but also about developing the higher rajasic force in order to bring about sattva. Similarly, Ayurveda may use strong healing methods, like powerful herbs or pancha karma to restore health. For either health or spiritual growth to occur, such a higher force of rajas or active energy of transformation is crucial. The or serpent power that awakens the subtle body. Kundalini sys­ Tamasic sattva, the resistance power of sattva guna, is also helpful at times. In the spiritual life it helps us resist any efforts to draw us away from the path. In healing it sustains the im­ Ayurveda and yoga use the three gunas for determining in­ dividual mental or spiritual nature. Generally one guna predomi­ nates in our nature. However, we all have spiritual or sattvic moments, rajasic or disturbed periods, and tamasic or dull times which may be shorter or longer depending upon our nature. We also have sattvic, rajasic or tamasic phases of life which may last The gunas show our mental and spiritual state through which we can measure our propensity for psychological problems. The follOwing test is a good index of these qualities and how they work within our life and character. The answers on the left indi­ cate sattva, in the middle rajas, and on the right tamas. Please fill out this form carefully and honestly. After answering the questionnaire for yourself, you should have someone who knows • • you well, like your husband, wife or close friend, fill it out for you also . Note the difference between how you view yourself For most of us, our answers will generally fall in the middle or rajasic area, which is the main spiritual state in our active and outgoing culture today. We will have various psychological problems but can usually deal with them. A sattvic nature shows a spiritual disposition with few psychological issues. A highly sattvic nature is rare at any time and shows a saint or a sage. A tamasic person has a danger of severe psychological problems but would be unlikely to fill out such a chart or even read such a book. The areas in ourselves that we can improve from tamas to rajas or from rajas to sattva will aid in our peace of mind and spiritual growth. We should do all we can to make such changes. Vata, Pitta and Kapha are called the three supports. Knowing this group of three as the sacred threefold The entire universe derives from three original powers of energy, light and matter. Science recognizes these as physical forces governing the external world but, from a Vedic stand­ point, they are powers of consciousness itself. Energy is the origin of the life force that is the most powerful of all forces. Light is the origin of the mind, through which we can see, know and discern. Matter is the basis of the body through which These three powers work through the three central elements . . Energy and life work through the element of air, which is active in nature, stimulating all things to motion. Air or wind is not simply an atmospheric force, but exists throughout nature as various currents and attractions arising through space. Space is not empty but is teeming with active energies at an invisible level. There is a solar wind,7 for example, and interstellar gases and their flows. The nerve force in the body is a kind of wind and the mind's force also travels like a breath of air. Light and intelligence function through the element of fire, from the galaxies, stars and planets in the external world to the lights of the senses and seeing power of the mind. Matter, par­ ticularly at a biological level, is dominated by the element of water, which prOvides stability and sustains the bodily tissues. Embodied life arises in water and is nourished by it. Yet on all levels a watery or cohesive force serves to hold things together. These three forces, when imbued with prana or the life­ force, create the three doshas: Vata, Pitta and Kapha, the air, fire and water humors. Vata, as wind, imparts energy, life, move­ ment and expression. Pitta, as fire, creates heat and light, through which we have vision, digestion, and transform ation. Kapha, as water, contains, supports and nourishes the other two forces Energy ultimately is the force of God, the Divine Will that rules all actions in the universe . It is not merely a blind or inanimate force but the very power of consciousness. Light is Divine Intelligence that becomes the basis for the individual soul or conscious Self in creatures. This life and mind is em­ bodied in the world through the medium of water, the worlds or realms of experience in which the soul takes birth. Energy is the spirit, which is formless. Light is the soul, which has a form dependent upon a fuel, the water that makes up the body. An early text on yoga relates this fact. 8 Air is God, spirit or pure consciousness, the formless force and presence that per­ vades everything. Fire is the embodied soul, hidden in the body like fire latent in wood. The spiritual life consists of awakening the light of fire, the soul's intelligence in our heart, and lifting it out of the limited bodily sphere into the unlimited realm of the Spirit, merging our individual fire into the cosmic air and space. The Dance of the Doshas 39 Our biological existence is a dance of the three doshas of vata, pitta and kapha. Life is a multicolored tapestry of their movement in various plays of balance and imbalance , coming together and going apart. These three powers color and deter­ mine our conditions of growth and aging, health and disease . Dosha means a fault or a blemish and indicates the factors that The doshas impact us on two primary levels. First, they are the factors that produce the physical body and are responsible for its substance and its function. Our tissues are mainly kapha or watery in nature. The digestive system is mainly pitta or fire. The nervous system is mainly vata or wind. Second, one of the three doshas predominates in each individual and becomes the basic determinate of his or her particular constitution or mind­ body type. In this regard, Ayurveda speaks of people as vata types, pitta types or kapha types relative to individual habits and proclivities from bodily structure to emotional responses. In the practice of yoga, both levels of the doshas are impor­ tant. First, an understanding of the doshas allows us to gauge the effects of yoga practice on both the gross and subtle bodies. Yogic views of anatomy, physiolog y and psychology were origi­ nally formulated in terms of the doshas. The doshas tell us how the various organs and systems of the body work from the yogic perspective of prana. They provide keys to the nadis and chakras of the subtle bo dy. Similarly the doshas help us understand how the mind functions, as well as its connection to the soul, which follows the same energies as the body but at Second, an understanding of ayurvedic constitutional types helps us adapt yoga practices according to individual require­ ments. The asanas, pranayama and meditation practices appro­ priate for one doshic type may not be useful for another. 40 Yoga and Ayurveda Ayurveda enables us to personalize yoga practices to the unique that yoga practice benefits our health but that it is able to actu­ alize our entire human potential. Yoga practitioners should know their ayurvedic constitution for the right application of prac­ tices. Yoga teachers should have knowledge of Ayurveda to vary the practices they recommend relative to individual needs. Ayurveda treatment occurs on two similar levels relative to the doshas. The first is treatment of disease, helping us deal with specific health complaints from common ailments to life­ threatening illnesses. On this level, Ayurveda is concerned with specific therapies to reduce doshic excesses. These therapies, like the prescription of powerful herbs, are usually performed by an Ayurvedic doctor. The second level is lifestyle manage­ ment. Ayurveda shows us how to live in harmony with our constitution, not only to prevent disease but also to utilize our full soul potential. On this level, Ayurveda deals with general lifestyle practices to apply in our daily lives, which rests more Yoga has a place in both levels of ayurvedic treatment. Yoga is a therapeutic tool of Ayurveda for both disease treatment and for lifestyle management. Yoga postures and pranayama treat a variety of ailments, particular ly structural problems or low en­ ergy conditions. Yoga is also excellent for psychological and mental disorders because of its specific action on the mind through meditation. However, yoga is probably more important for lifestyle management than for treatment of disease. Yoga pos­ tures, pranayama and meditation are among the best tools for Ayurvedic books go into great detail about the functioning of the doshas and can be consulted for more information in this regard. Here we will look into the doshas relative to the dosha or biological force. It is the motivating power behind the other two doshas, which are lame or incapable of movement without it. Vata is primarily ether in substance and air in motion. It exists as the air that we hold in the empty spaces of the body, like in the hollow organs, joints, and bone cavities, particula rly the hips and lower back. On an inner level, Vata's sense organs are the ears and skin and its motor or­ gans are speech and the hands, which relate to the ether and air elements and tanmatras. On an inner level, vata governs sen­ sory, emotional and mental harmony balance, and promotes mental adaptability and comprehens ion. Vata endows us with positive traits of creativity, enthusiasm , speed, agility and re­ sponsiveness that allow us to achieve our goals in life. Vata's primary physical site is in the colon. Vata is a posi­ tive factor in the energy produced through the digestion of food. ing from faulty digestion. Disturbed vata causes mental, ner­ vous and digestive disorders , including low energy and weak­ Yet vata is not separate from the other doshas. Like the wind that moves with the clouds in the sky, vata contains within itself subtle particles of water and the potential of fire in the vata generate the lightning or fire that gives rise to pitta and the watery particles or rain that give rise to kapha. Vata is the origin of the other two doshas. Proper balance of vata depends upon the right amount of pitta and kapha held within it, just as the 42 Yoga and Ayurveda amount of heat and water in the wind determines how it blows. The key to managing all the doshas is to care for vata. The cosmic vata, or Vayu, energizes and upholds dharma or cosmic law. Similarly, the proper control of vata brings dharma or natural fire cannot exist directly in the body, pitta exists in the body in the medium of oily and acidic secretions and so is said to con­ tain an aspect of water as well. Pitta is responsible for all forms of digestion and transformation in the body, from the cellular level to the workings of the gastrointestinal tract. Pitta governs digestion on mental and spiritual levels as well our capacity to digest impressions, emotions and ideas in order to arrive at a perception of truth. Pitta endows us with positive traits of intelligence , courage and vitality. Without it we lack the deci­ Pitta is located in the small intestine and stomach among the organs, the sweat and sebaceous glands, and the blood and lymph among the tissues. Its sense organ is the eyes and its motor organ is the feet, which relate to the element and tanmatra of fire. Its site of accumulation is in the small intestine, where it builds up as acidity. Pitta is produced as the positive energy or heat of the blood. As a disease factor, it manifests through excess or toxic blood that Pitta depends upon vata for its enervation and movement and on kapha for its support, just as fire requires both oxygen of vata or nervous energy within it and grounds itself with the appropriate kapha or water. The Dance of the Doshas 43 means \"what makes things stick together\" and refers to the power of cohesion. Kapha serves as the bodily container for pitta and vata, or energy and heat. Kapha itself, as water, is held in the medium of earth, the skin and mucous linings, Kapha is located in the chest, throat and head in the upper body, the sites of mucus production, but also in the pancreas, sides and stomach in the middle body where fat accumulates, and in lymph and fat tissues generally Its sense organs are taste and smell, the nose and tongue and its motor organs are the and earth elements and tanmatras. Kapha endows us with emo­ tion and feeling. This gives love and caring, devotion and faith, which serve to keep us in harmony internally and unite us with others. Kapha allows us to retain what we have achieved through Kapha's primary phYSical site is the stomach, where mucus is produced, which then overflows into the lungs and lym­ phatiC system. Kapha is produced through the plasma, which is the main kapha tissue in the body, providing hydration and nourishment to all the tissues. As a disease factor, Kapha mani­ fests through excess plasma that becomes mucus. This causes overweig ht, edema, lung diseases, swollen glands and other Kapha depends upon vata for its stimulation and move­ ment. It requires pitta for its warmth. The body, though prima­ that is cold or does not move cannot sustain life. • The Doshas create three different primary types of individual or worse than the others. Each has its benef its as well as its weaknes ses. Kapha types possess the strongest build but can lack in motivation and adaptation to use it properly Vata types have the weakest build but the greatest capacity for change and adaptation to protect it. Pitta types have moderate physical strength Below is included a simple test to determine the doshas in your own nature. No person is of one type only, so expect some combination of traits. The predominant trait will deter­ Yoga examines individuals in terms of their mentaVspiritual level according to the three gunas. Ayurveda looks at individu­ als in terms of their psychophysical constitution through the three doshas. Yet Ayurveda also considers the role of the gunas the doshas relative to physiological functioning. For a com­ plete ascertainment of the individual nature, both the gunic and The doshas are a biological classification that is horizontal in application, with no necessary spiritual implications. A vata type may be a saint or a sinner; the same is the case with the other two types. The gunas are a spiritual classification that is vertical in nature. It has no necessary physical implications. A saint or sinner may be vata, pitta or kapha in body. Putting these two classifications together like horizontal and vertical lines, we can arrive at a precise indication of where a person is at in life. Please do both the dosha and guna tests to see how these two factors combine in your nature, not only to learn if you are vata, pitta or kapha, but also to see if the dosha is at a level of sattva, rajas or tamas. The follOwing types show comprehension of diverse topiCS and qUick understanding of many points of view. They are excellent communicators with mobile and enthusiastic minds and personaliti es. They possess a strong sense of human unity, are receptive and sensitive to The Dance of the Doshas 47 others. They have a strong healing energy, abundant vitality, Rajasic Vata types are ever active, expressive and on the move, striving to achieve various and changing goals in life. Always restless and full of desire, they want to do more and more and can never rest satisfied with anything. They are easily distracted, pursuing novelty, and may become hyperactive and inconsis­ tent. Coming on qUickly like the wind, they can be overly talk­ Tamasic Vata types exhibit a deceptive, fearful and erratic be­ havior that easily becomes extreme, going against any order or courtesy. They are inclined to theft, prone to sexual perversions, easily addicted to drugs and other escapes, and sometimes sui­ cidal. They cannot be trusted with anything serious and play Sattvic Pitta types display higher qualities of light, intelligence and warmth, shining like the sun on everyone. They are disci­ plined, perceptive and discriminating in their thinking, always considering the point of view of others. They are friendly and courageous in their actions, with warmth and compassion for all. They function as natural leaders with strong wills for growth Rajasic Pitta types aim at achievement and success, often re­ gardless of the means or the method. They promote themselves and their agendas with skill and determination, not stopping until they have reached their goal of power and position. They are critical and controlling, prone to anger and intoleran ce. This leads them to be reckless and vain, which can bring about their Tamasic Pitta types are destructive and violent in their emo­ tions and behavior. They harbor much hatred, resentment and hostility in life and take it out on anyone who gets in their way. They do not respect any social laws or the feelings of others. Most criminal leaders and underworld figures are of this type. They may be paranoid or psychopathic and should be avoided Sattvic Kapha types exhibit kapha virtues of love, devotion, faith and contentment, which gives them a comforting presence to all who come into contact with them. They have much steadi­ ness, patience, equanimity and balance of mind. They are loyal, forgiving, nurturing and supportive. They view all creatures with Rajasic Kapha types aim at acquiSition and like to dominate others through controlling material resources. They are greedy and materialistic, seeking wealth and position for themselves and their family. Their goal is to accumulate all the good things of life, from home and clothes to property and assets of all types. They are driven to own and accumulate and are not sat­ Tamasic Kapha types are caught in inertia and stagnation, which often manifests as various addictions. Their minds are dull and insensitive and they are usually depresse d. They refuse to make blame others for their predicaments. They trample over others in their heaviness and lethargy. Their bodies Similarly are usu­ ally overweight and full of toxins. Yoga is severing the connection with that which The system of classical yoga was compiled by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras, based upon older traditions going back to Vedic times. Called Raja Yoga or the Royal Yoga, it covers the entire range of yogic practices from as ana and pranayama to mantra and the many forms of meditation. This integral yoga parallels an integral Ayurveda that Similarly deals with all aspects of our nature from body to soul and all possible healing methods from According to Patanjali, \"Yoga is the complete control of the operations of the mind.\"9 These operations of the mind, called vrittis, constitute all our mental activities from the deepest sub­ conscious memories to the highest superconscious insights. Patanjali is not referring to control of the mind in the ordinary sense but to a complete mastery of all levels of consciousne ss, including subliminal and cosmic layers not known to ordinary Only from such control of the mind can arise knowledge which is the ultimate goal of yoga practice. The silent mind becomes a mirror that reveals our real Self, whose nature is we transcend time, space and karma and enter into the infinite, we must have mastery of the body, senses and prana, as well as the outer aspects of our personal and social life. For this rea­ son, yoga does not neglect even common factors of diet and Raja Yoga provides an integral eightfold approach or eight are like the limbs of the body and work together in various ways. Each has its proper role necessary for right development, The first five limbs from yama to pratyahara make up the outer aspect of yoga. They are preliminary in nature, laying pects of our nature as body, breath and senses. The last three tion. They naturally go together. Attention naturally leads to meditation, which in time results in absorption or the unifica­ tion of the perceiver and the perceived. They bring us knowl­ Ayurveda harmonizes the body and prana to enable us to proceed with the inner process of meditation. It is mainly part of the outer aids of yoga. However, ayurvedic healing for the mind also involves the inner aspects of yoga like mantra and meditation. Ayurveda therefore shares the same scope as yoga The yamas or dharmic principles of social behavior are Right social behavior is important for health, psychological vances, we will have no harmful impact upon the world and not get entangled in external complications of wrong relation­ ships or wrong possessions . The yamas also are a code for physicians: not to cause harm, to tell the truth, not to get sexu­ ally involved with patients, not to charge undue fees for treat­ ment, and not to be attached to one's practice or its results. The niyamas or dharmic principles of personal behavior tablish a personal yogic practice in life. They are also the basis of ayurvedic life regimens for constitution balancing. Purity in­ cludes vegetarian diet and physical detoxification. Surrender to the divine is the key to sustaining all these practices, which dation of Kriya Yoga, the yoga of internal action that renders Yama and niyama constitute the dharmic or ethical founda­ tion for all right living, including the health practices of Ayurveda. These two sets of principles go together. Unless we have integ­ rity in our social interactions, we cannot have it in our per­ Asana means right posture or posture in harmony with our inner consciousness. Its aim is a sustained and comfortable sitting posture to facilitate meditation. Asanas bring balance and harmony to the phYSical body, particularly the musculoskeletal system that is the support of the body. Asana is part of the ayurvedic treatment system for the physical body. Postures can be used to increase vitality or to balance the doshas. They can be adjusted to target certain organs or weak spots in the body. Asana is a subject of a separate chapter in the book. Pranayama means not simply breath control but the con­ the breath, which is harmful, but contacting higher sources of prana both within and around us. Pranayama consists of deep­ ening and extending the prana until it leads to a condition of the senses, emotions and mind are put to rest. Pranayama is The Paths of Yoga 53 another important ayurvedic method for increasing vigor and vitality and promoting the power of healing. The issue of prana and the practice of pranayama are dealt with in several chapters. Pratyahara is not simply closing off the senses but right management of the senses and the ability to go beyond them. It is not suppression of the senses but their right application, which includes the ability to put them to rest. Ayurveda regards all diseases as based upon the wrong use of the senses. How we use our senses determines the kind of energy we take in from the external world to feed our minds, which either nour­ Pratyahara techniques involve either shutting off the senses, like closing the eyes or ears, or using our senses with attention rather than distraction. This includes various forms of mantra or visualization. Inner sensory sources may be tapped like the Dharana is control of the mind, which is right attention. It is the capacity to give all our mental energy at will to whatever we need to examine. Dharana involves developing and extend­ ing our power of our attention. Dharana techniques consists of various ways of directing or controlling our attention, like con­ centration on particular ob jects or ideas. Common dharana tech­ niques including concentration on the five chakras and their ruling elements. A second method is to concentrate the mind in the heart. A third method is to concentrate the outer space in the inner space that dwells within the heart. Dharana is men­ tioned in several contexts later in the book. • 54 Yoga and Ayurveda Dhyana is meditation, which is our capacity to sustain our attention without distraction. Meditation enables us to mirror reality and objectively perceive the truth of things. Meditation may be on an external object, like the ocean, the sky, or a statue of a deity. It may be on an internal object that we visualize like . a deity or a yantra. It may be on an idea or truth principle, like infinity or oneness. It may be without form altogether and to­ tally open. It may be active, pursuing a line of thought or in­ Meditation in the highest sense is not a technique. Medita­ tion techniques more properly belong to pratyahara or dharana. True meditation is the natural state of awareness, not a method. But this requires some preparation to reach, as indicated by the other limbs of yoga. A separate chapter is also devoted to medi­ Samadhi, which we could call absorption, is the capacity to become one with the object of our perception. It is the unity of the perceiver and the perceived in direct perception, through which the nature of ultimate reality can be clearly known. Samadhi is our capacity to merge with things in consciousness that shows our joy and fulfillment in life. It brings us to the underlying Divine nature in all things. It is the natural outcome of true meditation. Samadhi or union is the goal of all that we seek. Yoga does this inwardly so that we can be one with all. In yoga there is no insistence that all individuals must fol­ low one path or another. Yoga encourages us to follow the path that most appeals to our heart. There are many different paths The Paths of Yoga 55 and styles of yoga relative to different individual inclinations and the different aspects of our nature. This is similar to Ayurveda, which teaches various diets and life regimens according to dif­ ferent constitutional types. These paths of yoga can be summa­ rized under five different areas. Raja Yoga includes all the main. yogic paths, but these can be pursued separately as well. Yoga is first of all a seeking of knowledge , an inquiry into the truth of life, self, God and the universe . Yet it is a special type of inquiry, not done with the outer mind and senses but with the inner mind and heart. The yoga of knowledge is not primarily a practice of the thinking mind, though it does start out with a deep pondering of the primary questions of life and requires a rigorous rationalit y. It is a way of meditation that requires that the mind dwell in a state of peaceful observation to discover truth, not by thought but by perception. The yoga of knowledge is simple in its formulation but difficult to practice. It says that God or the Absolute is our true Self. All we need to do to find God is let go of our external involvement, give up all thought, and come to rest within our that arises from the heart as the root of all thoughts. It also employs various other methods of reasoning, discrimination and affirmation, including speCial mantras like Aham Brahmasmi, Because of its directness, the yoga of knowledge is recom­ mended mainly for the highest level of aspirant. Its foundation is complete renunciation and tremendous austerity such as few, particularly from our sensate and materialistic culture, can achieve . • However, most of us can benefit from the practices of the yoga of knowledge , like silent meditation on Brahman or inquiry into the Self, even if we are not at the highest level. Yet we must support these with other yogic diSCiplines to insure that our development is complete . Above all, the yoga of knowledge requires complete control of the senses and pranas, which rests The yoga of knowledge is particularly attractive to pitta or fiery types as it rests upon a clear focus of the mind and deter­ mined insight such as they are more likely to possess. How­ ever, vata or airy types are sometimes drawn to it because of their capacity for expansive thinking and detachment from the body. Kapha or watery types occaSionally follow it because their steadiness of mind allows them to develop deep peace and in­ Devotion is the path of divine love through which we seek to merge into the divine within the heart. It consists of the worship of the Divine Beloved as the ultimate reality, externally Devotion takes different forms relative to how we choose to approach the divine. Yoga grants us complete freedom in chOOSing whatever form of God most appeals to our heart. This derives from the same recognition of individual differences and teacher or guru, as a symbol of the divine teacher, may become the object of worship. Deities may also reflect ayurvedic ener­ gies and be used for balancing the prana and mind. Formless devotion or devotion to divine qualities and attributes is an­ There are many devotional practices the performance of assuming various attitudes or moods of divine worship. These are quite diverse but generally are approached spontaneously Bhakti yoga has a certain freedom, which is the power of inspi­ ration; therefore it is not as structured as the other yogas. How­ ever, to advance far along it requires purity, consecration and The yoga of devotion is the best means of healing the heart and our emotional nature, which in the modern world, with all our relationship problems , is often hurt or disturbed. This heal­ ing of the heart is emphaSized in ayurvedic psycholog y. Devotion appeals mainly to kapha types who are the most emotional of the three types. Kapha types have a natural love that best expresses itself through devotion. Pitta types can be devotional as well, but in their case their devotion is more de­ termined and concentr ated, like the warrior serving his king or queen. Vata types are the least devotional but benefit the most from devotion because it is the best thing for calming the heart . and relieving the fear and anxiety from which they are more Karma yoga refers to the yoga of work or action, which is and the upliftment of the world. The second part is service to living beings. All spiritual teachings speak of the need to help 58 Yoga and Ayurveda the world and to uplift humanity Most practitioners of yoga are expected to do some work of service, called seva in San­ skrit. This may consist of providing food or clothing to the poor or needy, working in schools or hospitals, or distributing books and teachings. It is not limited to helping people but extends to helping animals, plants and the planet itself, includ­ ing various forms of social and political activism. Most yogic paths begin with the student taking up some karma yoga or service activity from cooking, cleaning the ashram or adminis­ The two aspects of karma yoga are related. All service is a divine ritual. All ritual has as its aim the upliftment of living beings. All yogas are rooted in karma yoga. One's spiritual practice should be a service to all beings or it has little val ue. Even liberated souls are not free from the practice of karma yoga, which compels them to return to the world to help the igno­ rant. Karma yoga is the beginning and the end, the lowest and the highest of all the yogas. Those who neglect it miss the real Kapha types prefer karma yoga that takes a nurturing role, caring for others. Pitta types prefer social or political activism that projects a cause to help change the world. Vata types prefer karma yoga that engages the mind, like writing or teaching. Karma yoga is an important ayurvedic tool of psychological healing and the foundation of ayurvedic life regimens. If what we do is not a form of service, it is bound to breed physical or Yogic science has its own technolog y, consisting of various methods and techniques involving body, breath and mind, to help unfold our deeper awareness. These all fall under the yoga action, process or movement, particula rly the internal unfold­ ment of prana and mind to bring about purification and trans­ formation so that we are ready for deep meditation. or mature our spiritual aspiration. This includes everything from fasting to meditation as means of developing and energizing dharma, which implies understanding one's ayurvedic constitu­ tion as well. Surrender to God is not only devotion but learn­ In the yogas of knowledge and devotion, techniques are der. But most aspirants, particula rly in the modem world, re­ quire a good deal of work and purification to become capable of true insight or divine love. It is very difficult to go directly to God or the Self even for the best people in the best of times. To proceed without techniques can be to take the hard path, like trying to go on foot when a good vehicle is there to speed us on our journey. However, some people overemphasize tech­ nique, which, without knowledge or devotion, must remain artificial and sterile. Technique should be blended with knowl­ edge and devotion for it to best proceed and it should be done Kriya yoga appeals mainly to vata types who like move­ ment and action. However, pitta types, who like to work with fire and energy and have a scientific bent, may be drawn to it as well. Kapha types are least likely to be drawn to it but benefit greatly from more action and the movement energy that it af­ fords. There are many aspects of the yoga of technique. Below we list some of the main approaches. 60 Yoga and Ayurveda Mantra Yoga: includes all forms of prayer, chanting and singing the praise of God. It is connected with music, poetry, symbology and mythology, which are all different levels of the mantra. All yoga paths employ some mantric approach. The yoga of knowledge uses mantras like Aham Brahmasmi or \"I am God.\" The yoga of devotion employs names of God such as Om Namo Bhagavate Vasudevaya or \"Reverence to Krishna.\" Karma yoga is performed while chanting devotional mantras. Yoga techniques emphasize mantras chanted along with Mantra is perhaps the main method of the yoga of tech­ nique. It is more important than asana and could be called asanas for the mind. All yoga and ayurvedic practice should begin and end with mantras, as well as using mantras along the way. Ayurveda considers mantra to be its most important heal­ ing method after the use of herbs, so all ayurvedic practitioners should study mantra yoga. Note speCial chapter on mantra. Tantra: literally means technology and refers to various tech­ niques or methodologies of yoga including mantra, yantra, vi­ sualization, and devotional worship, including various forms of temple worship. It is not simply sexual postures, which is merely one side of tantra and one of its lower forms. Tantra is an energetic approach teaching us how to work with energy on a subtle level. Tantra, therefore, is mainly a path of raja yoga because of its integral nature and, secondar ily, a path of kriya yoga because of its practical side. Tantric yoga has been the most prevalent form of raja yoga since medieval times in India. It uses all eight limbs of Raja Yoga, adding to it specific forms tantra that employs practices not considered to be dharmic or ered appropriate for individuals who have not yet advanced to the stage of higher yoga practices and are still caught in desire modern world are at this stage, such tantra can have great ap­ peal and is not without its possible value. It is always impor­ tant to start where we are in life. But such tantra should not be confused with higher tantric yoga practices that proceed through mantra and meditation and follow the way of renunciation. In tantra we find the most clear description of the subtle kundalini working through them. Kundalini yoga is part of tantra. Tantric methods are often combined with those of Ayurveda, particularly for purposes of healing the subtle body and rejuve­ nation of the physical body. Ayurvedic alchemy, the use of spe­ cially prepared mineral and mental preparations and rejuvenative herbs, is part of a tantric approach. The use of gems links not Tantra combines a wealth of techniques that are quite useful for Hatha Yoga: is the most commonly known of the yogas of technique. It literally means the yoga of effort or force. While the tendency is to identify it with the physical yoga and asana practice, it is more than that. Classical hatha yoga texts like Hatha Yoga Pradipika and Gheranda Samhita are tantric and teach . not only asana but a whole range of tantric methods of purifi­ hatha yoga because in hatha yoga texts we find the most de­ tailed explanation of various asanas. In this regard, the best asana teachers and perhaps the greatest development of asana can be found in the West today. In India the main yogic path is devotion and asana is generally treated superficially. • However, Western hatha yoga seldom goes into the medita­ tion parts of classical hatha yoga. Therefore it is not entirely correct to call it hatha yoga. Classical hatha yoga was a path for hermits, requiring great physical austerity. It employs powerful methods of internal cleansing that demand very special living circumstanc es. Hatha yoga is said to lead us to Raja Yoga or the higher yoga, in which meditation becomes the main concern. Owing to its connection with the physical body, hatha yoga is closely linked with Ayurveda and describes asanas in ayurvedic terms. Ayurveda employs the asanas of hatha yoga as one of its mainly healing modalities . It also recommends various purifi­ cation measures of hatha yoga for healing purposes. Hatha yoga is particularly useful for vata types who need to be more grounded in the physical body, but it is useful for the other ayurvedic types as well. However, its stronger practices should be taken up with caution as they can aggravate vata severely. Ayurveda itself is a form of yoga. It can be called the yoga of healing. Ayurveda employs aspects of all the yogas depend­ ing upon the level, temperament and constitution of the indi­ vidual to aid in their healing, right lifestyle and spiritual devel­ opment. A true ayurvedic practitioner, therefore, is also be a yogi. He or she has mastery not only of the physical body but of the pranas and the mind, with knowledge of the subtle body through his or her own personal energy. The mind of a true healer is attuned with the divine or the inner Self. Ayurveda should be practiced as karma yoga, as a form of service to living beings. It should be done for the purpose of helping others, not merely for ones own personal or material benefit. Without this sense of service, the spiritual side of The Paths of Yoga 63 of hatha yoga and its understanding of posture, breath and awareness. Yet Ayurveda also employs the techniques of raja yoga for healing the subtle body and soul. Those studying Ayurveda should examine the Yoga Sutras as well and have a Ayurveda uses mantra yoga as a means not only of healing but of projecting all healing energies. Ayurvedic medicines are traditionally prepared with mantras which serve to energize them on a subtle level. In addition, ayurvedic therapies are tradition­ ally given along with the chanting of mantras. Along with Ayurveda, one should learn the basics of the Sanskrit language and the science of mantra so as to be able to benefit from this Ayurveda recommends bhakti yoga or devotion as one of the main tools of healing the heart. All those who seriously aspire to understand Ayurveda must recognize the supreme power of devotion and divine love for all deeper healing. In this re­ gard, ayurvedic people should have a chosen form of God to worship that reflects their own devotion and faith in divine healing. This can be Dhanvantari, the deity of ayurvedic medi­ cine who is a form of Vishnu, but it can be any of the names and forms of God or great teachers of humanity. Ganesha is also popular among ayurvedic practitioners. Many others prefer Ayurveda recommends jnana yoga or the yoga of knowl­ edge for healing the mind, which requires meditation. Ayurveda amination even if this requires painfully examining our own Of course, an ayurvedic practitioner cannot be expected to 64 Yoga and Ayurveda be proficient in all these yogas, but he or she must at least be aware of them and be capable of directing people to teachers who can help them along these paths. Only a great ayurvedic master will know all these yogas and be a doctor not only of Yoga, too, should include Ayurveda in order to be com­ plete. Hatha yoga is incomplete without an ayurvedic view of the body. Raja Yoga is incomplete without an ayurvedic under­ standing of the mind. All yogis must recognize the importance and value of right diet and herbs as yogic tools, and of ayurvedic purification measures like pancha karma as tools to prepare the Generally, however, Ayurveda works at healing and purify­ ing the body and mind while yoga aims at taking us to Self­ realization , which depends upon a purified body and mind. In this way, the foundation of yoga should be Ayurveda and the collection of three bodies that constitute various densi­ ties of matter, from the gross elements to most subtle layers of the mind. Behind these bodies resides our true Self that is beyond all manif estation, mental or physicaL The three bodies, therefore, are not bodies in the ordinary sense but rather When yoga and Ayurveda address the human being and its needs, they are referring to this greater human being of the three bodies, not merely to the physical self, which in itself is little more than a collection of flesh and bones. Nor are they mainly addressing the higher Self or pure consciousness beyond all rance and therefore does not need any help. Yoga and Ayurveda seek to unfold the mysteries of the subtle and causal bodies which serve as bridges to this higher Self. Without the devel­ opment of these inner vestures, it is not possible to reach the In this chapter we will discuss these three bodies along with their related five sheaths.

We can observe the soul's magnetism in our hu­ man interactions. We speak of magnetic personalities who have the power to draw people to them. Such individuals usually have a strong force of personality. However, this personality force is not always from the soul. It can be a thing of persua­ sion, sex, or manipulation. There are several levels and aspects of personal magnetism. Only the awakened soul, aware of its magnetic force. An unevolved soul can generate a strong ego energy, particular ly if it has some mass following, which has its We all gravitate toward that with which our soul has affin­ ity. This is owing to the magnetic nature of the soul. We draw to us people and circumstances that are in harmony with our soul and the type of manifestation that it is seeking. As we evolve spirituall y, the Godward magnetized soul draws to itself its inner unfoldment. Our soul's magnetism, which is its power of love, brings us into various relationships and links us with other souls who further our soul quality and help us grow. This power of soul magnetism is the basis of the yogic empha­ situations that test it and challenge its growth as well, just as an advanced mountain climber will seek difficult slopes to climb. Therefore, association is the main factor that magnetizes the soul. There is a entire science of association and personal mag­ netism known to yogis. The people we are drawn to in life reflect the nature of our soul's magnetism. So, too, the people we associate with in life hold our soul under their magnetic The Soul and Its Different Bodies 73 influences, which can either be hypnotic or enlightening. For this reason, yoga emphasizes right association as the founda­ tion of yogic practice. Ayurveda similarly emphasizes right rela­ tionship as the basis of health. Unless we bring harmony into our relationships, the root of health and spiritual growth within us remains impaired. Wrong relationships not only cause emo­ tional unrest but lead to improper actions with the body, mind and senses. After all, what we do and even what we eat reflects If you want to understand the nature of your soul and its level of development, examine your relationships, not only physical ties but the people you emulate at a heart level and who function as your role models. The soul is reflected not so much by what we know but in the strength of our character, which is sustained by the people we look up to. The integrity of character projects the highest magnetic force that serves to integrate not only our own being but those of others. The magnetic force from the Creator determines the univer­ sal manif estation. Like all magnetic forces, it has a dualistic nature or polarity. There is both a cosmic force of attraction and one of repulsion. The attractive force has an internalizing or spiritualizing effect and elevates our consciousne ss. The re­ pulsive force has an externalizing or materializing action and lowers consciousness. The attractive force promotes unity, healing and integratio n. The repulsive force causes conflict, disease and The cosmic force of repulsion governs the descent of spirit into matter and creates the external world of names and forms. The cosmic force of attraction is the force of evolution that 74 Yoga and Ayurveda draws the embodied soul back to its divine Self and origin. These two forces are antithetical and mutually repulsive . The attractive or spiritual force repels the repulsive or worldly force. but attracts unspiritual energies to itself. This force of repulsion to the divine and attraction to the external world is called maya, force of divine attraction is called grace or Divine Shakti, the The soul can be magnetized in one of these two directions. It can be drawn inwardly to divinity or externally to the outer world of enjoyment. It can be receptive to the magnetic force of divine attraction or that of divine repulsion, either moving to­ ward the spirit or away from it. Divine attraction stimulates us to seek God or eternal truth. Divine repulsion creates attach­ ment to external people and things, drawing us into transient The force of divine attraction awakens our soul, making us conscious of ourselves as an immortal part of divinity seeking spiritual growth in the evolutionary cycle of rebirth. Divine re­ outer or bodily identity, whose main goal is enjoyment in the external world. The force of divine repulsion or worldly attrac­ tion brings the soul into embodiment and causes it to seek happiness externally. This allows the outer forms and forces of the universe to be created. The force of divine attraction or de­ tachment to the world then comes into play to complete the cycle of creation by drawing the soul back to its inherent divinity. Both these magnetic currents are cosmic in nature and pos­ sess tremendous force. They are like two torrents, whose en­ ergy is irresistible. Whichever one we open ourselves up to will carry us along like a log upon a fast flowing stream. At the The Soul and Its Different Bodies 75 soul level we have only one basic choice: Which of these two types of magnetism should we become receptive to? Which of these two currents should we enter? Shall we function as spiri­ tual beings seeking the unfoldment of consciousness in the universe or as egos, seeking our personal domination and en­ We can observe to what degree our soul is magnetized to the divine or the undivine, to spiritual or worldly forces. We can see whether our love and attention is naturally directed in­ ternally to consciousness or externally to the world of form. We can see if our nature is to seek inner peace or outer enjoy­ ment, inner expansion of awareness or outer expansion of pos­ sessions. As our present humanity is not very spiritually evolved, we will observe that most of us are caught in the current of ignorance and only have moments in which we are receptive to divine grace. However, we can cultivate this inner power and through it change the course of our lives. The inner current can overcome the outer current if we open ourselves up to the flow The magnetic force of maya or ignorance has three levels of operation, each of which has its characteristic quality and ac­ tion. Our consciousness tends to get magnetized on one of these sattva, rajas and tamas, which are nature's three forces of knowl­ Tamas is the darkest and heaviest magnetic density of igno­ rance. It draws to us forces of obstructi on, decay and disinte­ gration. It is the strongest force of the repulsive energy and serves to hold objects in form. Tamas inherently resists the 76 Yoga and Ayurveda divine will and is not receptive to any higher growth. We must let it go its own way until the shocks of life force it to change. Rajas is the middle density of ignorance . It creates illusions, fantasies, speculations, and imaginat ion. It draws us into in­ volvements , entanglements, complications and endless activity The rajasic force can recognize the divine will, but distorts it according to its own ends. It can be turned into a spiritual Sattva is the subtlest density of nature and can reflect the power of divine attraction. It attracts what is refined and noble charity It possesses little resistance to the divine will but can remain outward in its orientation and get us caught in the ex­ ternal forms of goodness, if we do not direct it within. It easily becomes a spiritual force if used with knowledge, skill and Rajas and tamas make up the lower magnetic forces the powers of cosmic repulsion that bind the soul to the external world. Tamas causes ignorance and rajas brings about attraction to the external world. The higher potentials for the gunas occur mainly through sattva, though it is possible for the divine will to work through higher forms of rajas and tamas as well. The three gunas comprise the magnetic field for the soul. One guna usually predominates and polarizes our mind and life according to its qualities . Souls become either sattvic, rajasic or tamasic in nature. However, in the ordinary, unrefined field of human nature, one guna seldom prevails. After a time the other gunas must assert themselve s. Our lives are an interplay of dullness, distraction and virtue, with shifting currents of good Only a rare human being can become so totally dominated The Soul and Its Different Bodies 77 by one guna that the other gunas lose their power. Such ex­ treme types ate the hardened criminal or complete tamasic type, the super achiever or complete rajasic type, and the selfless saint or complete sattvic type, but even these types can have their admixtures of the other gunas. Both Ayurveda and yoga seek to reduce the lower gunas of rajas and tamas. They are factors of mental and physical disease which Ayurveda addresses and the The causal body or core mind is made up our deepest thoughts, desires, aspirations and intentions. These are called samskaras or vasanas in Sanskrit and are the magnetic imprints on our mindstuf f, much like DNA holds the genetic code for the body. Samskara, meaning an imprint, refers to the seed motivations behind our behavior. Vasana, meaning a perfume, refers to how the deeper mind is shaped and colored by our moods and mental states. These tendencies hold the magnetic force that sustains our level of awareness. They reflect the gunas The higher spiritual magnetism or power of divine attrac­ tism, the power of divine repulsion, makes up the ego force or the power behind the development of true character and per­ sonality. The ego force is a power of personality without char­ acter. The soul force is developed through honesty, truthfulness and other ethical virtues, particula rly through receptivity and caring for others. It cannot be developed through mere wishful thinking, emotional highs, or temporary experiences. It is the product of our daily action, particularly our most frequent thoughts and expressions. To function from the level of the soul in our human interactions is indeed difficult, though very rewarding if we make the effort. 78 Yoga and Ayurveda Yoga as a spiritual practice is only possible for the soul, for a person who has awakened his or her spiritual aspiration and longs to go beyond the cycle of rebirth. Yoga as spiritual prac­ tice is not possible for the unawakened or immature ego, which joyment. To awaken at the level of the soul is the first step of genuine yoga practice and precedes even the yamas and niyamas, which require a soul awareness to be able to practice. If you wish to practice yoga, you must ask yourself: \"Is the soul awake Ayurvedic healing is based upon our connection with the soul that is the origin of life and the energizing force behind all our faculties. Ayurveda works through the soul force so that we can master our physical body and integrate all our faculties to gain harmony and balance. All true healing comes from the soul, the conscious being within, which when awakened be­ Out of magnetism, electricity automatically arises. The mag­ netic polarization or charge of the soul sets forth electrical cur­ rents and draws other currents to it from the external world. Out of the soul or heart arises the various electricities that sus­ tain activity on all levels of our nature. The soul generates the force that creates and motivates the mind, senses and body. This electrical force is called vidyut shakti, literally \"lightning\" in Sanskrit. The magnetic sphere of the soul gives rise to an electrical field that creates the subtle or astral body, the sphere The two basic polar energies of the soul give rise the two repulsion, inhalation and exhalation, eating and elimination. These two pranas generate an electrical force that divides itself The five pranas, by their interaction with the mind, give These factors have already been noted in the scheme of cosmic evolution, the tattvas of the Samkhya system. The five pranas will be discussed in detail in the chapter on prana. These electrical forces can function relative to any of the five magnetic levels of soul consciousness, from tamas to pure sattva. For example, our senses function at the level of tamas when they are dull and heavy On the level of rajas, they draw us to distraction and involvement. On the level of ordinary opment. On the level of pure sattva, they function as powers of insight. On the transcendent level, they are withdrawn into in­ On the lower levels, these electric forces work at low fre­ quencies. Their action is slow and they make very few connec­ tions. On a higher level, their frequency rate increases. They make many connections and can penetrate eventually through all the levels of the universe of mind and matter. A true yogi experiences these forces in his own consciousness like perpetual lightning reverberating in all directions . This shows their full 80 Yoga and Ayurveda This electrical body is called the subtle body because it is a vesture of energy more refined than physical matter. It is called the astral body because it is a field of light, the auric field of the mind and senses. Yet because its light is reflected from the soul, which is like the sun, it is called the lunar body The subtle body is built up from the essence of energy and impressions, the pranas and tanmatras, which are the electrical forces that it brings into itself. As an electrical field it is highly active, mov­ ing and ever changing, dancing with all the fluctuations of the sense organs, motor organs and mind that are never restful even The subtle body has a form similar to that of the physical body which it creates, but it exists more as an impression than as a specific object. The subtle body energizes and vitalizes the physical body, which it encompasses through the nervous and respiratory systems. All physical diseases have their origins in works to promote the healing powers of the subtle body, par­ ticularly its different pranas, to regenerate the physical body that arises from it. Yoga works to spiritualize the subtle body to turn it into a vehicle of spiritual realization. Both subtle and causal bodies are different aspects of the entity that we usually call the mind, which has more levels and powers than what we ordinarily experience even in a highly intellectual life. The causal body is the deeper, subliminal or interior mind, beyond form and sensation, while the subtle body is the formal aspect of the mind, the outer layer of which The awakened or consciously functioning causal body is the field of superconsciousness beyond form, a purely ideal field of perception. The awakened subtle body is the field of superconsciousness within form the realm of pure form, The casual and subtle bodies are closely related and are sometimes spoken of as one body.is The causal body endures throughout the entire cycle of rebirth. It undergoes an evolu­ die. A new subtle body is manifested out of the causal body with each birth and becomes the basis for the physical body, The causal body therefore is the seed or unmanifest form of the subtle body. The subtle body is the manifest form of the causal body. All the potentials of the subtle body are inherent in the causal body. Like a turtle that puts forth its limbs from its shell, the causal body unfolds the astral body. The causal body generates magnetic energy that gives rise to the electric force of the subtle body. This in turn creates a kind of rain that densifies as the gross or phYSical body. The electric force of the subtle body becomes the life force in the physical body. The magnetic force of the causal body becomes the indwelling consciousness or soul. The physical body, by its density, obstructs both the light and magnetism of the causal body and the electrical force of the subtle body. Its obstruction to the causal body, which is more refined, is greater than that of the subtle body. Yet these obstructions can be overcome by purification of the body and development of higher awareness ies. The causal body provides the basic pattern and laws for it to follow. The genetic code, the magnetic imprint behind the physi­ cal body, is connected to the causal body. The subtle body's mind, prana, sense and motor organs shape the corresponding faculties of the physical body. The physical body encases the mind, senses and pranas in the denser medium of the bodily tissues. The body is a creation of the gross elements. It is domi­ nated by the doshas or biological humors of vata, pitta and kapha which are manifestations of prana at a gross level. Ayurveda describes the physical body according to its tissues, systems and organs. However, to change the physical body on a fundamental level, we must change the forces that produce it, its energetic electricity or astral background, and its magnetic imprint or causal basis. This is also the key to rejuvenation. The three bodies relate to the three states of consciousness of waking, dream and deep sleep. The physical body functions during the waking state, in which we live in a world of physi­ cal objects with specific form and location in time and space. For this body to exist, we must take in the gross elements that compose it and which link us to the form world. Without the continual support of food, the gross body perishes. The astral body functions during dream and inspired thought, in which we live in a world of our impressions. It defines time and space rather than being defined by them, as is the case with the physical body. It is sustained by impressions , the subtle elements which are its food, through which we create an inter­ The causal body functions during deep sleep and profound meditation, during which we live in our own consciousness The Soul and Its Different Bodies 83 devoid of external objects, perceived or imaginar y. The causal body is not located as a form or an impression in space and time, but exists as idea that creates time and space according to its qualities. It is sustained by our deeper thoughts and percep­ tions, the causal elements which are its food, through which These three states of consciousness reflect the process of death and rebirth. At death the physical body is withdrawn and the astral body comes into function just as in sleep and dream. function in the astral. The impressions gathered in life get re­ vealed and through them one experiences happy or unhappy astral states, which in their extreme forms can become heavens and hells. Once these impressions are released, the astral body is withdrawn and the causal body comes into function. Prana and intelligence withdraw from the astral body and take one into the causal realm. The deeper qualities the love and wis­ dom that one has gathered in life are revealed and through them one experiences causal states, which are formless states of awareness. Once these are exhausted, then, from the causal body, new astral and physical bodies are set forth for another incarna­ The physical, astral and causal bodies make up five sheaths or layers of matter, with one intermediate sheath existing be­ tween the physical and astral bodies, and another between the physical and the causal. The three main functions of the mind constitute the three most subtle sheaths. Our inmost feelings, what is called chitta in yogic thought, make up the bliss sheath, the love at the core of our being. This is also the foundation of the mind or its inner aspect.

The pranic sheath in its outer aspect makes the physical body, which is otherwise a mass of flesh, come alive with sense and motor organs. Through its inner aspect, which is otherwise an expanse of space, it is able to manifest and express itself through the sense and motor Yet prana has even more subtle actions than the pranamaya kosha, which is only its sphere of manifestation. A seed prana as the energy of the deeper mind and soul. In fact, the highest nature as well. Intellect, its lower function or discrimination directed toward the outer world, allows us to organize our impressions into fields of knowledge. This works along with the senses as part of the astral body and manomaya kosha. Its higher function is true intelligence or discrimination directed towards the eternal. This puts us in contact with universal law 86 Yoga and Ayurveda transcends the senses. The bliss aspect of buddhi or intelligence, the happiness and peace that comes through knowledge , func­ tions through anandamaya kosha. Through the five sheaths we can understand the three bodies with more specificity is an alchemical process of balancing and transfoIm ing the energies of the psyche. To approach it we must understand how to work with these energies in a practical way. In this chapter we will introduce a deeper level of the doshas that is important relative to yogic practice. Vata, pitta and kapha have subtle counterparts called prana, tejas and ojas, which could be called \"the three vital essences .\" These are the root or master forms of vata, pitta and kapha that control ordinary psy­ chophysical functioning and, if reoriented properly, energize higher spiritual potentials as well. They are not simply forces of the physical body but of the subtle and causal bodies as well. Prana, tejas and ojas are the essential or beneficial forms of vata, pitta and kapha that sustain positive vitality. Unlike the doshas, which are factors of disease, they promote health, cre­ tions, responsible for coordination of breath, senses and mind. On an inner level, it governs the unfoldment and harmoniza­ Tejas inner radiance: the subtle energy of fire as the radiance of vitality through which we digest air, impressions and thoughts. On an inner level, it governs the unfoldment of all higher per­ Ojas primal vigor: the subtle energy of water as the stored­ up vital reserve, the basis for physical and mental endurance; the internalized essence of digested food, water, air, impres­ sions and thought. On an inner level, it is responsible for nour­ ishing and grounding the development of all higher faculties. These three forces are interrelated. Prana and tejas are rooted in ojas and can be regarded as aspects of ojas. Tejas is the heat and light energy of ojas that has an oily quality and, like ghee, can sustain a flame. Prana is the energy and strength that comes from ojas after it has been kindled into tejas. Ojas proper is the potential, the stamina of the mind and nervous system for holding Prana, tejas and ojas resemble the concepts of chi, the Yang mic breath, is like the primordial chi, which also relates to wind and spirit. Tejas as the power of will and vigor resembles original Yang, which is the primal fire. Ojas, as endurance and stamina, resembles primordial Yin, which is the essence of water. The main rule of ayurvedic treatment is to prevent any of the doshas from becoming too high because in excess they cause disease. The dosha predominant in our constitution tends to­ ward excess and must be restrained through the appropriate lifestyle • Prana, Tejas and Ojas 89 regimen. This is achieved through following the right diet, herbs, exercise, and meditation that counter doshic proclivities. In the practice of yoga a new rule comes into play. The yogi seeks to increase all three forces of prana, tejas and ojas. As these are the purified forms of the doshas, they do not have cause problems if one is increased at the expense of the others. They are basically wholesome energies that aid in renewal and transformation. The question is how to keep them growing at a similar rate so that their imbalance does not cause problems. Increased prana is necessary to provide the enthusiasm, cre­ ativity and adaptability necessary for the spiritual path, without which we lack the energy and motivation to do our practices. Increased tejas provides the courage, fearlessness, and insight to take us along the path, without which we make wrong choices and judgments or fail to be decisive in what we do. Increased ojas is necessary for the peace, confidence and patience to keep our development consistent, without which we lack steadiness and calm. Should any of these factors be insufficient, our spiri­ tual growth will be limited. These same factors increase posi­ tive health in both body and mind, and are helpful in treating all diseases, particula rly of a chronic nature, including promot­ To understand these three forces let us examine how they Prana, tejas and ojas are nourished by the reproductive fluid which functions as their support in the physical body. They are is the latent state of the reproduct ive fluid that provides not only reproduct ive power but strength in general and nourishes all the bodily tissues from within, particularly the nerve tissue. Ojas is our power of endurance and ability to sustain us, not only sexually but through all forms of exertion, physical and Tejas is the activated state of the reproduct ive fluid when it is transformed into heat, passion and will power. This occurs not only in sexual activity but whenever we are challenged or need to exert ourselves. Tejas gives us valor, courage and dar­ ing. In yoga this force is necessary to enable us to perform ating capacity inherent in the reproductive fluid. This aids in longevity and rejuvenation and stimulates the flow of prana through the nadis, giving a deeper energy to the mind. Without the proper reserve of reproducti ve fluid, we will become defi­ cient in prana, tejas and ojas. Wrong or excessive sexual activ­ Prana, tejas and ojas relate to the endocrine system. Prana governs equilibrium, adaptabil ity, and growth processes. The pineal and pituitary glands, which are the master controllers of growth and intelligen ce, are prana predominant. This is why most disorders in the growth process, like in people who are Tejas governs metabolism and digestion. ThyrOid and pan­ bolic problems are tejas in nature. Ojas governs reproduction and energy reserve and dominates in the testes, ovaries and adrenals. Most problems of the reproduct ive system are ojas related. Ojas also allows us to handle stress through sustaining Prana, tejas and ojas give energy to the immune system. Ojas is the basic capacity of the immune system, our potential to defend ourselves against external pathogens. It provides en­ durance, resistance and strength to ward off diseases. Tejas is the immune system which is able to burn and de­ stroy toxins when activated. It generates the fever that the body produces to destroy the pathogens which attack it. Tejas is our ability to overcome acute diseases, which are generally infec­ tious in nature. Tejas is ojas converted into heat, warmth and vitality. It is our ability to mobilize our immune system's forces. dealing with a chronic disease. It is the adaptability of the im­ sufficient prana, tejas and ojas, no disease can approach us. In­ creasing prana, tejas and ojas helps all low immune conditions. The nervous system is the master system governing all bodily systems. The three vital essences are responsible for its proper function. Prana governs the discharge and coordination of nerve impulses, which are pranic and vata forces. When deranged, it causes hypersensitivit y, tremors and imbalances in the nervous system. Tejas provides acuity of perception and feeling. De­ ranged tejas burns out the nervous system, causing inflamma­ tion and scarring of the nerve tissue. Ojas gives endurance and stability through the nervous system. It is responsible for the lubrication of the nerve channels. Nervous breakdown or ner­ Prana, tejas and ojas govern the movement of impulses through the nadis as well. Ojas is the fluid that lines the nadis, cushioning the flow of energy through them. Tejas is the heat 92 Yoga and Ayurveda moving through them. Prana is the energy moving produced by the heat of tejas. To safeguard the nadis we must protect The three vital energies are closely connected to the breath through the pranamaya kosha. Prana is the basic energy and movement of the breath, its propulsive source and power of action. Tejas is the heat produced by the breath, including its ability to vitalize the blood. Ojas is the deeper energy that we absorb through the breath and store at a deep level of the heart When prana is deranged, the breath becomes shallow or disturbed. When tejas is deranged, the heat content of the breath is abnormal. When ojas is deranged, the absorbed energy of the breath is low. We are unable to hold and consolidate prana .. Those practicing pranayama should maintain a close examina­ tion of the condition of their prana, tejas and ojas. Prana, tejas and ojas as powers of the mind function through the senses. Prana allows for the equilibrium and coordination and our ability to digest sensory impressions. It dominates in sible for stability of the senses, as well as for their lubrication. On an inner level, prana, tejas and ojas are measures of creativity Ojas is latent creative capacity, our storehouse of cre­ ative energy Tejas is creative vision, the ability to see new things and break with the past. Prana is creative action to bring new things into being and remain in the creative state. Proper ojas is necessary to give us a good reserve of creative energy to draw upon. Proper tejas serves to direct our creative energy toward specific goals and projects. Proper prana functions to keep our creativity mobile and transformative . Without sufficient prana, tejas and ojas, we are unable to make positive changes in our Prana, tejas and ojas exist on deeper levels of the mind and soul. The pranic force behind the mind allows it to move and respond, providing its basic energy. The tejas force of the mind allows it to perceive and to determine, giving it light and heat. The ojas force of the mind gives it patience, consistency and Each sustains certain emotions. Prana gives emotional har­ mony, balance, enthusiasm and joy Tejas gives courage, fear­ lessness, and daring that allows us to accomplish heroic or extraordinary actions. Ojas provides emotional peace, love, calm and contentment. Without these emotional forces the mind re­ Similarly, there is a prana in our deeper consciousness that gUides the soul throughout the entire process of incarnation, creating and energizing its various embodiments . The soul's tejas is its accumulated inSight and wisdom, its flame of spiritual aspiration. The soul's ojas is the material through which it pro­ duces and sustains all of its various bodies. These higher forms 94 Yoga and Ayurveda of prana, tejas and ojas reside along with the soul in the spiri­ tual heart, which is their ultimate point of origin and end. The",

      "description": "Ojas, as a subtle material substance and essence of the tis­ sues, requires the material support of a right diet. This involves a nutritive vegetarian diet with the use of whole grains, seeds and nuts, oils, root vegetables and natural sugars. A cruder form of ojas can be developed through animal products but this is too heavy to be of any value for the spiritual path.

      "description": "Controlling speech means avoiding aimless talking and gossiping and also avoiding critical and abusive speech. Periods of silence are helpful, like not speaking one day a week or being silent in the evening. This helps develop an internal energy of insight and takes us more into a witnessing state. Other austeri­ ties, such as fasting or staying awake at night, are helpful in developing tejas because they increase our fire of determination. 98 Yoga and Ayurveda Mantra is a higher form of control of speech that develops the inner fire. The Goddess Kundalini is said to wear the gar­ land of the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet around her neck. She is made up of mantra. There are many ways to use mantra. Repetition of the Sanskrit alphabet is one way. Repetition of is another. Longer mantras like Gayatri are very good. Gener­ ally mantras should be first spoken out loud for a short period of time, then muttered with a low voice for a longer period, and then repeated on a purely mental level for a yet longer period. There are mantras useful for ojas and prana as well, on a particular object, which may be outer like a flame, inner like visualization of the form of a deity, or an element, idea or truth principle . Concentration gives acuity of mind that causes our inner fire to come forth. Concentrating on the inner light perceived in the region of the third eye is an important method to develop tejas. Learning to direct our power of vision helps in this regard. Tejas is what allows the third eye to open. particular ly the practice of various forms of inquiry, like Self­ inquiry. This consists of holding to the inquiry \"Who am P\" and letting go of other thoughts . Tejas arises through the devel­ eternal from the transient , the unchanging truth from changing names and forms. This is the main movement of our inner Prana, Tejas and Ojas 99 Once ojas and tejas are developed, a higher prana can come forth. Prana is developed specifically through pranayama, but Pranayama develops prana not only on an outer but also on an inner level. As the ingoing and outgoing breaths become balanced, we contact our inner prana. This we experience as a sense of lightness, expansion or ascension of energy. However, pranayama can be used for developing tejas and ojas as well and can aid in the integration of all three factors. Pranayama generates heat, particularly through retention of the breath, that It helps transform the reproduc tive fluid and lower forms of ojas into a more spiritual form. Note chapters on prana and Meditation on space or the void is another way to develop prana. Prana is born of space. Wherever space is created, prana must come into being. Creating inner space creates the inner prana automatically. Another method is to meditate upon the inner sounds, which arise from the inner space. The heart itself is the region of inner space and the ultimate source of sound. Meditation on sound and space in the heart connects us with 100 Yoga and Ayurveda Raja Yoga emphasizes using prana to calm the mind along with other techniques of mantra, concentration and meditation. Prana is the mobility and adaptability of consciousness brought about by employing various diverse methods of meditation. According to Raja Yoga, the vrittis or movements of the mind are controlled by prana. By prana we can control the mind. Raja Yoga is an integral approach combining both the yoga of knowledge and the yoga of devotion. This also helps de­ velop prana, which is born of the union of wisdom and devo­ tion. In this regard, the practices mentioned under both ojas and tejas must be done together. For example, generally the yoga of knowledge is best done in the morning and the yoga As these three factors are always closely related, the prac­ tices help develop each other. An integral development of prana, tejas and ojas, therefore, is the key to a balanced inner growth. Of these the most important is ojas. Ojas not only gives a strong reserve of vital energy, it also provides strength and maturity of character and �motional stability. Ojas creates the vessel neces­ sary to hold prana and tejas, which would otherwise disperse. One may have a very intelligent mind or sensitive heart but these will not take us far spiritually without the proper ojas or vital juice to support them. Without ojas, exercises in medita­ tion and yoga lack the proper foundation. Perhaps the first question for an individual attempting real yogic practices is: Prana is held by ojas, which is its conductor. If we increase Prana, Tejas and Ojas 101 prana without ojas, adding energy without being able to ground it, we may disturb, if not derange, the mind and nervous sys­ tem. Tejas rests on ojas, which is its fuel. If we increase the without increasing ojas, we will literally burn ourselves up. Spiritual knowledge can only burn if fed with the fuel of love. Once sufficient ojas is there, one needs to develop tejas in order to utilize it. This requires will, inSight and discernment: choosing the right path and follOwing it consisten tly. Then one can develop prana, which comes from the union of tejas and ojas. Once we have the right foundation and are taking the right path, prana allows us to move swiftly along the way. Generally any excess of the doshas, whether vata, pitta or kapha, will eventually weaken all three forces of prana, tejas and ojas. The doshas when excessive also prevent their own High vata dries up ojas as wind dries up water. It weakens tejas as wind agitates a fire or blows it out. However, high vata depletes prana as well. When vata is formed as a waste gas, the subtle energy of prana, which is like a rarefied fragrance, can­ High pitta burns up ojas, as too high a flame consumes the oil that feeds it. It weakens prana in the same way that heat and fever exhaust our vitality. Yet high pitta also damages tejas. Pitta dosha is a crude form of tejas that cannot be converted into the subtle essence of tejas, just as oil that is filled with contami­ nants cannot produce a good flame. Let us take an example. Tejas is valor and courage. High pitta is anger and paranoia. When pitta is in excess, these higher qualities of tejas cannot High tejas and prana can damage ojas but these are tempo­ rary because they are destr oying their own root. Excess tejas is like a high fire that consumes its fuel and must eventually go out. This is like a soldier on a battlefield who pushes his cour­ age until he loses it and turns into a coward. It is different from high pitta because exhaustion of ojas in this case is not caused by a toxin but by excessive use of a positive energy. Similarly, a person with a great deal of creative prana can exhaust their ojas by overwork. Young people in particular can have high levels of prana or tejas for some time before their ojas gets depleted. This is because they have a good congenital ojas to draw upon. Deeper vitality disorders involve imbalances of prana, tejas and ojas, which affect the deeper bodily systems the ner­ vous and reproduc tive systems, the senses and the mind. These include growth disorders in children, premature aging, meta­ bolic problems, hormone imbalances, nervous system prob­ lems, allergies, and most degenerative diseases from cancer to AIDS. When these subtle master energies are deranged, physi­ cal function is disturbed at a deep level with ramifications on all systems and organs. Psychological imbalances affect prana, tejas and ojas, which are closely connected to the senses, emo­ tions and mind. These include anxiety, anger, depression, at­ tachment and grief. By increasing prana, tejas and ojas, most Most meditation disorders are caused by imbalanced devel­ opment of prana, tejas and ojas. Their main cause is insuffi­ cient ojas. Without the proper ojas, increased tejas can bum up the nadis of the subtle body. This can occur from excessive practice of meditation or mantra without the proper ojas to sustain it. Without the proper ojas, increased prana can move in erratic ways. This can occur from excessive practice of pranayama or trying to empty the mind without having the proper • ojas to support it. We should be careful in attempting powerful Yoga is an alchemical process that requires knowledge of the forces that we are working with. It is not mere wishful thinking, nor does it occur only in the mind. The ayurvedic science of prana, tejas and ojas provides the understanding of the subtle forces of yoga. While it is a more complex matter than the synopsis given in this chapter, the reader should have is a ritual fire in which we offer our body, life and mind into the flame of awareness that is our true Self. This inner fire takes us across the dark night of igno­ rance to the perpetual day of enlightenm ent. A great yogi is a living flame whose very presence fills us with light, warmth The practice of yoga is all about creating the fire of yoga, which should be its foundation. Similarly, Ayurveda is a great fire offering. We must create the fire of healing to make our­ selves well and to sustain positive health and vitality. An ayurvedic doctor should have the warmth of that cosmic flame of life. This principle of fire in the universe is called agni in San­ skrit, meaning \"the transforming force.\" It is not simply fire in the elemental sense but all potentials of heat, light and electric­ ity. This divine fire is the origin of life, light and love the powers of the soul that motivate us from within. The soul it­ self is our inner fire, the spiritual aspiration deep within us that accompanies us through all our births. It is the inextinguish­ able flame, the witness behind all our states of consciousness, Yoga and Ayurveda are both sciences of agni or the divine that through it we can achieve all necessary balance and growth. The cosmic fire that exists outwardly on all planes of the uni­ verse, from gross matter to pure being, has its counterpart within us on all layers of our individual nature, from the physical body to our immortal consciousness. It is the catalytic force necessary for any evolutionary change to occur. Ayurveda em­ phasizes the role of agni on a physical level and shows us how to balance our digestive fire as the basis of physical health. Yoga emphasizes the fires of prana and meditation as the means The Vedas teach an elaborate fire ritual called yajna or sacri­ fice. Yajna refers to a redirection or transformation of energy, a change of substance from one level to another. The idea behind the yajna is that whatever one offers to the divine must be trans­ In the yajna a special fire is made according to a specific procedure. An altar or fire pit is constructed. Special wood is used as fuel and the fire is enkindled in a precise manner, pref­ erably by the rubbing together of sticks. In this sacred fire we place various offerings, like rice or ghee, that both feed the fire and are transformed by it into various essences. Along with these offerings we recite various prayers and mantras, seeking to fulfill our wishes and bring divine blessings into the world. The fire is the messenger between the material world and • Agni Yoga: Harnessing the Fire 107 higher spiritual realities, between man and the gods. What we offer in the· fire is carried to the invisible realms where higher powers can recognize and act upon it, sending back their grace. Such a sacred fire serves to purify the environment , not only on a gross but on a subtle level. It works to purify the astral bodies of those who perform it regularly. Such a ritual should Fire offerings can be used to achieve the ordinary goals of life like health, wealth and prosperity. They can be done for inner purposes of working out difficult karma, propitiating negative planetary influences, or consecrating various spiritual practices. They are part of a universal technology of inner evolution. The ashes of the fire, called bhasma, possess purifying, healing 108 Yoga and Ayurveda and curative powers. Sometimes special herbs go into their making. Such bhasmas can be used to potentize other medi­ cines or are taken as a medicine themselves. Bhasmas made in the presence of great spiritual masters are particularly powerful. The most important times for fire rituals are sunrise, noon and sunset offerings, called agnihotra or fire invocations. New and full moon offerings are also important and, in Vedic times, various seasonal and yearly offerings were performed as well. Such transitional or juncture points, called joints or sandhis in Sanskrit, are times at which energy naturally changes and can In the ayurvedic fire ritual, the fire is the digestive fire or jatharagn i. The offerings are the food that we eat. This is called pranagnihotra, or the pranic fire offering, as taught in the Vedas. In this we offer our food not only to the jatharagni but to the Before eating we should first sprinkle some pure water around our food to purify it. One can simply chant OM while doing this or do the whole Gayatri mantra, if one knows it. Then one should chant: \"You are the tablecloth of immortalit y, Swaha!\"19 and sip a little water. Then one should recite the man­ tras to the five pranas, at each time taking a little food in the mouth, remembering the prana and its action as a divine force Then one should finish the meal and recite: \"You are the covering of immortalit y, Swaha!\"2o Swaha is the mantra for making any offerings to the sacred fire. In this way the food we eat nourishes all our pranas through the instrumentality of the di­ Yoga is an inner fire ritual that does not use external ingre­ dients but rather the different faculties of our nature. In the practice of yoga we offer all aspects of our being into the inner fire of God. There are different yogic fire rituals depending which faculties we offer. Yoga uses the fire of breath and mind to pu­ rify and transform our consciousness. This occurs by linking ourselves with the divine fire that is God or the inner Self. It requires awakening the fire of our soul to take us back to the god or divine sun within. Our subtle body and its system of nadis and chakras is like a great tree that needs to be lit up by the inner fire of kundalini which emanates from the soul. The yogi himself becomes fire, which opens his third eye and be­ comes a force that he can project upon the world. All true yo­ Many forms of agni exist in the world of nature and direct the process of evolution. First is the elemental fire that exists in the Earth and in the stars, which itself has many forms. Then there is the vegetable fire that produces organic life through photosynthesis. This gives rise to the animal fire that breeds emotion and passion. The animal fire deepens into the true human fire that promotes truth and compassion. This gener­ ates the angelic fire that enkindles love and devotion. These five cosmic fires relate to the five koshas defined be­ low. Highest is the atmic fire or fire of the Self that is pure 110 Yoga and Ayurveda consciousness, which is also the Brahmic fire or absolute flame Each of the five koshas or encasements of the soul has a different form of agni responsible for its development. Like the digestive fire, agni on all levels is the force of growth and bal­ ance, allowing nutrients to be taken in and waste materials to which dwells in the abdomen, particular ly in the small intestine where the main digestion of food occurs. The digestive fire breaks down the food we eat into the essence of the five elements. From its action arises the digested food mass that provides nourish­ ment to all the tissues through the plasma. Through it we digest food, which gets transformed into the tissues of the body. The act of eating, taking the food into the mouth and the tion of the food. The action of digestion, breaking down and absorbing the food in the small intestine is the field of pitta the waste gases are held and released. So all three doshas can The physical agni is closely linked with speech, which is the dominant action of the mouth. In fact, the physical body is a tube built around the digestive tract whose main opening is the mouth. Right eating and right speaking are complementary processes of the food sheath. One should take care not only what goes into the mouth but what comes out of it. AgniYoga: Harnessing the Fire 111 The agni of the pranic sheath is pranagni, the agni of prana. It works in the lungs and heart and connects with the jatharagni in the solar plexus below, which is also the physical pranic center. Pranagni is responsible for converting oxygen from the external air into an internal force of vitality. Pranagni connects with the blood, serving both to oxygenate it and to give it a red calor. Through pranagni we digest air or prana, which gets transformed into energy. The energy of the breath is more subtle The action of inhalation, like that of eating, is in the field of kapha and that of exhalation, like eliminati on, in the field of vata. Pranagni is energized through retention of the breath, which is connected with pitta. Pranagni is also connected with speech, The agni of the outer mind is the fire of perception, manasika agni. This allows us to 'digest sensory impressions . Among the sense organs, the mental fire is most connected with the eye, which corresponds to fire among the senses. Among the motor the speech within the mind, our internal voice. The mental agni digests impressions and turns them into our inner landscape, The agni of intelligence is the fire of discriminati on, through which we can discern truth and falsehood, good and bad, right and wrong. The fire of the outer mind is neutral morally. It simply digests impressions. The fire of intelligence digests these further, extracting their meaning, quality or content their 112 Yoga and Ayurveda underlying idea. From it our basic values and beliefs are con­ structed. The agni of intelligence builds up the body of dharma, The agni of this sheath is the fire of love, which in the undeveloped person is the fire of desire. This is the flame of our deepest wishes, motivations and aspirations. Desire can be transformed into the fire of divine love and bliss. This depends upon feeding our fire of bliss not with sensory enjoyments but with devotion to the divine. The agni of bliss takes in the feel­ ing content of our experience and extracts delight out of it. This is the body of joy that wisdom allows to grow.",

Until that is developed, the higher aspects of The practice of Raja Yoga and its eight limbs is designed to develop all five agnis to aid in our inner purification and trans­ formation. The yamas and niyamas, the rules and disciplines of the yoga system, serve to put our outer life in order so we can prepare the fuel of our nature for its enkindling by the divine fire. Their practice serves to mature our character so that it can hold the inner fire. Unless the fuel, which is our mind and body, is prepared properly it cannot be burned by this inner power. Yogic disciplines of nonviolence , truthfulness, control function make the fire of our life glow more brilliantly and ripen our character for spiritual practice to be efficacious. 21 The practice of asana or yogic postures serves to balance, stabilize and further enkindle the jatharagni or physical agni, which helps purify the physical body. When the physical body is still, relaxed and balanced, the digestive fire is also balanced and purified. Correct performance of asana results in good di­ gestion and elimination, a regular and healthy but not excessive appetite. Various postures aid in the increase of the digestive fire, particularly sitting poses and uddiyana bandha. The main purpose of pranayama is to develop pranagni, the fire of the prana for purification of the prana, nadis and subtle body. Pranagni develops mainly between inhalation and exhalation. Pranagni, we might add, is a force different than the five pranas yet connected with all of them as their heat and Pranayama, deep breathing combined with retention of the breath, increases pranagni. Pranagni increases body heat lead­ ing to sweating, which helps purif y the nadis. The combina­ tion of pranayama and mantra aids in its development and in",

      "description": "All that exists in the three heavens rests in the control change something we must alter the energy which cre ates it. This fact is true in the practice of yoga as well as in Ayurveda. To bring about positive changes in body and mind we must understand the energy through which they work. This is called prana in Sanskrit, meaning primary en­ ergy. It is sometimes translated as breath or vital force, though While the subject of prana is common in yogic and ayurvedic thought, prana and its different subtypes are seldom examined in depth. For this reason, the vast and profound science of prana is rarely understood. In this chapter we will look into this force because prana is the main link between yoga and There is an old Vedic story about prana that occurs in vari­ ous Upanishads. The five main faculties of our nature the each other as to which was the best and most important. This reflects the ordinary human condition in which our faculties are not integrated but fight with each other, competing for their rule over our attention. To resolve this dispute they decided that each would leave the body and see whose absence was First speech left the body, but the body continued thoug h mute. Next the eye left, but the body continued though blind. Next the ear left, but the body continued though deaf. Then the mind left, but the body continued though unconscious. Finally the prana began to leave and the body began to die and all the other faculties began to lose their energy. So they all rushed to prana and told it to stay, lauding its supremacy. Clearly prana won the argument. Prana gives energy to all our faculties, with­ out which they cannot function. Prana takes the first place and without it we do not have the energy to do anything. The moral of this story is that to control all our faculties the key is the control of prana. Prana is the master. Prana is the boss. It is the power of God within us. Without the sanction of prana noth­ ing can be done either at a voluntary or involuntary level in body and mind. Unless we learn how to work with our prana, Prana has many levels of meaning from the breath to the energy of consciousness itself. Prana is not only the basic life­ force, it is the master form of all energy working on the levels of mind, life and body. Indeed the entire universe is a manifes­ tation of prana, which is the original creative power. Even kundalini shakti, the serpent power or inner force that trans­ forms consciousness, develops from the awakened prana. On a cosmic level there are two basic aspects of prana. The first is the unmanifest aspect of prana, which is the energy of pure consciousness that transcends all creation. The second or manifest prana is the force of creation itself. Prana arises from Of the three gunas, sattva or harmony gives rise to the mind, rajas or movement gives rise to the prana, and tamas or inertia Secrets of the Five Pranas 121 prana or rajas.

From the unmanifest Relative to our physical existence, prana or vital energy is a modification of the air element, primarily the oxygen we breathe that allows us to live in the physical world. Yet as air originates in ether or space, prana arises in space and remains closely connected to it. Wherever we create space, there energy or prana must arise automatically Air and space, energy and space, and energy and mind, which is a kind of space, remain closely linked The element of air relates to the sense of touch, which is the subtle air element. Touch is the subtle form of prana. others, which is why touch and embrace are so stimulating. Yet . as air arises in space, so touch arises from sound, which is the sense quality that corresponds to the element of ether. Through sound we awaken and feel our broader connections with life as a whole. On a subtle level, prana arises from the touch and Pranamaya kosha is the sphere of our vital life energies. This sheath mediates between the body on one side and the English term for the pranamaya kosha is the \"vital sheath\" or \"vital body,\" a term from Sri Aurobindo' s Integral Yoga. Pranamaya kosha consists of our vital urges of survival, reproduction, Most of us are dominated by the vital body and its deep­ seated urges such as eating and reproduction, which are animal in nature that are necessary to sustain life. The vital body holds a vital or subconscious ego which is the source of the various fears, desires and attachments that cause us pain. Most of us spend our time in life seeking enjoyment through the vital body in the form of sensory pleasure and acquisition of material objects. The vital body, like prana, is dominated by A person with a strong vital nature becomes prominent in life and is able to impress his or her personality upon the world. Those with a weak vital nature lack the power to accomplish anything and have little effect upon life, usually remaining in subordinate positions. Generally, people with strong and ego­ istic vitals run the world, while those with weak vitals follow them. Such a strong egoistic vital is one of the greatest ob­ stacles to the spiritual path. The person feels powerful in their ego identity and cannot surrender to any higher or impersonal A strong vital or pranamaya kosha, however, is important for the spiritual path, but this is very diff erent than the egoistic sonal power but from surrender to the divine and the cosmic life force. Without a strong spiritual vital, we lack the power to do our practices. In Hindu mythology this higher prana is sym­",

Health also depends upon a strong vital, which imparts energy and vigor to the physical body. But in Ayurveda true health is of the spiritualized vital nature, not of the egoistic vital.

Udana is the vital energy Samana: literally the \"balancing air,\" moves from the periphery to the center through a churning and discerning action. It aids in digestion on all levels. Samana works in the gastrointestinal tract to digest food, in the lungs to digest air or absorb oxygen, and in the mind to homogenize and digest experiences, whether sensory, emotional or mental. Samana is the vital energy in the navel, where our energy is centered and where digestion occurs. Secrets of the Five Pranas tions and thoughts circulating in the mind, imparting move­ ment and providing strength. In doing so it assists all the other pranas in their work. Vyana is the vital energy in the heart and While the action of the pranas can be localized to some degree, we must remember that it occurs on all levels because the main role of prana is to link things together. This is also mic principles of Samkhya. It is common to them all. Yet the In terms of the physical body, prana vayu governs the move­ ment of energy from the head down to the navel, which is the pranic center in the body. Apana vayu governs the movement of energy from the navel down to the root chakra and all the way down to the feet. Samana vayu governs the movement of energy from the entire body back to the navel. Vyana vayu gov­ erns the movement of energy out from the navel throughout the entire body. Udana governs the movement of energy from the navel up to the head. The navel is the main prana center in 126 Yoga and Ayurveda the body, in which all the pranas are held like the spokes in the As a simple summary; prana governs the intake of substances; samana governs their digestion; vyana governs the circulation of nutrients ; udana governs the release of positive energy that follows digestion; and apana governs the elimination of waste materials. This is much like the working of a machine . Prana brings in the fuel. Samana converts the fuel into energy. Vyana circulates the energy to the various work sites. Apana releases Udana governs the positive energy created in the process and determines the work that the machine is able to do. As a diagram of forces, samana governs the center while vyana governs the periphery. Udana governs upward movement, while apana governs downward movement. Prana gives energy to all in harmony. When one prana becomes imbalanced, the others become disturbed as well because they are all linked together. Generally prana and udana work opposite to apana as the forces of energization versus those of elimination. Similarly vyana and samana are opposite as forces of expansion and contraction. The pranas as forms of energy work on all the elements . Prana energizes the elements in whatever they do. Udana gov­ erns the upward transformation of the elements, allowing earth to become water, water to become fire, fire to become air and air to become ether. Apana governs the downward transforma­ tion, allOWing ether to become air, air to become fire, fire to become water, and water to become earth. Vyana allows for the differentiation of the elements and grants each their separate sphere of activity. Samana brings about the integration of the The pranas have specific elemental connections as well relate to the throat chakra. Vyana relates to air and touch, which relate to the heart chakra. Samana relates to fire and sight, which relate to the navel chakra. Apana relates to earth and water and to smell and taste, which relate to the root and sex chakras. Prana is connected to all the elements but more specifically to the water form of apana, which is the basis of life and procre­ ation. Prana also rules the mind from its cent er in the head. Prana governs all forms of energy in the universe, not just that is connected to gravity Light moves by the power of prana. Prana prevails in the eastern direction which is the direc­ tion of light and life. Vyana prevails in the south, the direction of growth and expansion. Apana prevails in the west, the direc­ tion of decay and decline. Udana prevails in the north, the di­ rection of death and ascension. Samana connects all the pranas Prana also governs time. Prana propels the movement of time, which is the movement of life experience. It brings us into birth and carries us along our life journey Vyana allows us to expand within the field of time. Apana causes us to decline. Udana allows us to move on in time to a higher sphere. Samana",

      "description": "Without prana the physical body is no more than a lump of clay. Prana sculpts this gelatinous mass into various limbs and organs. It does this by creating various channels or nadis through which it can operate and energize gross matter into Prana vayu creates the openings and channels in the head and brain. There are seven openings in the head: the two eyes, two ears, two nostrils and mouth. These are called the seven pranas or seven rishis in Vedic thought.23 Udana creates the chan­ nels in the throat and neck, particular ly those of the tongue and vocal organs. Both prana and udana help create the mouth which is the main opening in the head and in the body. It could be said that the entire physical body is an extension of the mouth the Apana vayu creates the openings in the lower part of the body, those of the urinogenital and excretory systems. Samana vayu creates the openings in the middle part of the body, those of the digestive system, centered in the navel. It opens out into the channels of the intestines and the organs, like the liver and pancreas, which secrete into it. Vyana vayu creates the channels going to the peripheral parts of the body, the arms and legs. It creates the veins and arteries and also the muscles, sinews, joints and bones. Apana aids vyana in creating the legs, while udana In summary, samana vayu creates the trunk of the body vayu creates the limbs. Prana and udana create the upper open­ ings or bodily orifices, mainly the head, while apana creates governs the lower part of the body. Vyana governs the front • • Secrets of the Five Pranas 129 side of the body which connects to the limbs that mainly move forward. Udana governs the back, which allows the body to stand up. Samana connects all the parts of the body together in In addition each prana relates to one of the seven bodily tissues. Prana creates the nerve tissue; apana creates the bone tissue; udana creates the muscle; samana creates the fat or adi­ pose tissue; and vyana creates the connective tissue, sinews and Relative to the bodily organs, prana itself works mainly in the brain, senses and heart. Udana works in the stomach, lungs, and throat. Vyana works through the lungs and heart. Samana works through the digestive organs, particularly the small intes­ tine, liver, stomach and pancreas. Apana works through the kid­ neys, urinary bladder and reproduc tive organs, the lower organs. The five pranas are forms of vata, but all the doshas de­ pend upon them for their right function both through expres­ sion and eliminati on. Udana vayu moves upward to eliminate kapha or mucus. This occurs through coughing, expectorating or vomiting, including the emetic therapy of pancha karma. Samana increases agni, the digestive fire, which helps bal­ ance the doshas. This is the basis of the shamana or pacifying methodology of Ayurveda. Prana, by increasing intake of nutri­ ents through the mouth and the senses, calms the doshas, par­ Vyana by outward motion promotes sweating and relieves tox­ ins through the skin. This helps open the channels to draw the 130 Yoga and Ayurveda toxins back into the digestive tract for their eliminati on. The five pranas have their connections with tejas and ojas as well. Apana governs ojas, which develops through the re­ producti ve tissue. Samana controls tejas as not only the diges­ tive fire but all other fires in the body and mind. Disease mainly begins at the level of prana in the head, with head colds. It moves to the region of udana with sore throat. Then it descends to the region of vyana with lung infec­ cur as pathogens move into the region of samana in the small intestine and liver. Finally toxins enter the region of apana in the kidneys and reproductive organs where they create long­ Prana exists on the level of pranamaya kosha, which is its native sphere. This impacts the physical body primarily through the breathing process, which is the main form of pranic activity in the body: In this regard prana governs inhalation. Samana governs absorption of oxygen that occurs mainly during reten­ tion of the breath. Vyana governs its circulation. Apana governs exhalation and the release of carbon dioxide. Udana governs the release of positive energy through the breath, including speech that occurs through the outgoing breath. We will discuss this The mind also has its energy or prana. This derives mainly from our intake of sensory impressions and is reflected in our Secrets of the Five Pranas 131 Prana on a psychological level governs our receptivity to mental sources of nourishment, sensations, emotions and ideas. It gives energy, vitality and speed to the mind. When deranged, prana causes wrong desire and insatiable craving. We become misguided, misdirected and wrongly motivate d. We run after things in the external world rather than following our own in­ Apana on a psychological level governs our ability to elimi­ nate negative thoughts and emotions, which become toxins in the mind. It gives us detachment and dispassion, functioning as our mental immune function. When deranged, apana causes fear and depression. We get clogged up with undigested experi­ ence that weighs us down in life, making us suppresse d, stifled Samana facilitates mental digestion, providing nourishment and contentment to the mind. It gives us mental discrimina­ tion, concentration and balance. Through it we can unite with what we put our minds and hearts upon. When deranged, samana brings about attachment and greed. We become contracted and tied up inside ourselves, clinging to wrong attitudes, beliefs Vyana promotes mental circulatio n, the free flow of ideas and emotions. It gives comprehensivene ss, agility and inde­ pendence to the mind. When deranged, vyana causes separa­ tion, hatred, and alienation. We are unable to unite with others or remain connected in what we do. We overly expand our energies to the point at which they dissipate or disintegrate. Udana provides positive mental energy, will, and strength. It gives us joy and enthusiasm and helps awaken our higher spiritual and creative potentials. When derange d, udana causes pride, willfulness and arrogance . We become ungrounded, try­ ing to rise too high, and lose track of our roots. 132 Yoga and Ayurveda Prana therefore is our positive propulsive energy in life, our ability to move and develop. Apana is our capacity to with­ draw our energy and to eliminate things from ourselves. Vyana to hold and contract. Udana is our ability to ascend, rise up and grow. The five pranas are just the five expressions of our energy. Learning to use them, we can gain control over all as­ The pranas have many speCial actions in yogic practices. On a spiritual level, samana vayu governs the space within the heart in which the true Self, the Atman, dwells as a fire with seven flames. This is also called the internal space or atmo­ sphere, antariksha, the hidden space between things. Samana regulates agni with fuel, which must burn evenly. Without the peace and balance of samana, we cannot return to the core of Vyana governs the movement of prana through the nadis, keeping them open, clear, clean and even in their functioning. A strong vyana is necessary for purification of the nadis. It expands the mind into the infinite. Apana protects us from negative en­ tities and experiences on the path. Prana itself gives us the proper aspiration and motivation for our spiritual development. Udana governs our growth in consciousness and also brings about the movement up the sushumna. The mind moves with udana vayu.25 This takes us to the states of dream and deep sleep. After death it leads the soul to the astral and causal planes. Udana is often the most important prana for spiritual growth. As we practice yoga, the subtle aspects of these pranas be­ gin to awaken. This may cause various unusual movements of Secrets of the Five Pranas 133 energy in body and mind, including the occurrence of various spontaneous movements or kriyas. We may feel new expanses to the nectar born of the Moon, to the state in which the Great Shakti, who is the Self of consciousness. Yoga in the deeper sense requires awakening the kundalini or serpent power. Kundalini is the higher evolutionary force hidden within us that has the ability to unfold our spiritual potential . In its unawakened state, a mere fraction of its energy serves to uphold our normal psychophysical functioning. In its awakened state it reveals our capaCity for cosmic conscious­ These evolutionary potentials exist as latent energy centers in the subtle body, the seven chakras, which kundalini acti­ vates. Chakra refers to a wheel or a moving circle of energies. The chakras are also important in ayurvedic healing, particu­ larly relative to the prana and mind, which works through them. The chakras direct and gUide the physical body from behind The seven chakras comprise three primary regions. The three between the heart and the navel. Kundalini and the Chakras 137",

      "description": "The lower set of three chakras reflects more physical and vital functions, including most health issues, through the doshas. Vata has a special relationship with the root or earth chakra, which serves to stabilize it. Kapha connects with the water chakra. Pitta relates to fire. The heart chakra reflects emotional issues. The head chakras reflect spiritual issues. Similarly, there are three levels of working on the chakras relative to physical disease, 1. Physical diseases relate to imbalances in outer chakra func­ tioning through the various nerve plexus and endocrine organs with which the chakras correspond and to the three doshas of 2. Psychological diseases involve imbalances in inner chakra functioning, particula rly relative to prana, tejas and ojas, which are the energies of the subtle body, the mind and its field of 3. Spiritual or yogic development aims at opening the chakras. 138 Yoga and Ayurveda This requires transcending their ordinary functions in our per­ sonal nature to the level of the cosmic. Yogis merge the chakras of the astral body into the causal body, reversing the entire pro­ cess of creation. They merge earth into water, water into fire, fire into air, air into ether, ether into mind, mind into intelli­ Most chakra healing today emphasizes external measures of gems, herbs, body work, sound, color therapy, and vibrational healing. In addition, psychic healers can work on the chakras through their own prana or chi, which they direct as a healing force. Ayurveda employs such modalities for treating disease and promoting health and vitality These approaches are very important for chronic conditions, weak immunity, and deep­ Most books on chakras today describe the chakras as force centers within the physical body, with the sushumna or central channel identified with the spine. They relate the chakras to the various spinal centers and the physiological processes these govern like digestion, respiration or reproduction. Yet while the chakras do impact the physical body, which they form and Some healers claim that working on the chakras with such outer methods can open or awaken the chakras. These state­ ments must be taken with caution. According to yoga, in the ordinary human state, which it is extremely difficult to tran­ scend except by sustained spiritual practice, the chakras remain closed; that is, they do not directly function at all. The result of this is not necessarily disease but spiritual ignorance . This con­ sists of regarding the external world as the true reality and liv­ ing unaware of one's true Self, which is neither body nor mind One's chakras can be closed on a spiritual level and yet one Kundalini and the Chakras 139 can be healthy, emotionally balanced, mentally creative, and suc­ cessful in life. This depends upon outer, not inner chakra func­ tioning. Opening the chakras is not a process for improving one's capacity in the regular domains of human life, though it may offer this as a Sidelight , but for going beyond the ordinary human condition to a higher evolutionary state. The chakras can only be truly opened through inner practices of pranayama, mantra and meditation. Outer aids, from diet to gems, can be helpful but must remain subordinate to these higher modalities Much of our thinking today, even in spiritual and New Age fields, is still cast in a materialistic paradigm in which we try to tality is used to approach subtle phenomena like the chakras, pranas or doshas. However, it is wrong to think that the chakras are like the limbs and organs of the physical body that can have little variability in their form, function or appearance. The chakras are energetic and functional centers, not physical posi­ tions. We experience them at certain points in the physical body more so than others but their action impacts the entire physical body, the mind and what is beyond as well. The result is that the chakras work in different ways at different times and for different people. They can be correlated with various phenom­ ena on different levels relative to how the energy is working through them. For this reason all books on the chakras, in­ cluding yogic accounts, may not agree in every detail. Such views may represent different insights or different methods of working with the chakras. They are not necessarily wrong, but traditional yoga teachings on the chakras should be given pri­ ority, given the long experiential tradition behind them. The subtle body is the body of our impressions and our pranas. Can one put an impression in a box?

Can one say where the wind is located or where it goes when it ceases to blow? Correlations are means of drawing connections and, as connections are ultimately universal in the spiritual realm, such correlations must have variability. We must learn to look at the subtle body according to its own reality that encompasses and interpenetrates physical reality on many levels, not which is simply parallel to physical functioning. The subtle body creates its own time and space, like a dream or a vision. It is not limited by external factors and forms. Moreover, the opened chakras are not part of the ordinary functioning of the astral body either. They relate to its height­ ened or spiritually awakened role. They represent the absorp­ tion of the astral body back into the causal body and pure consciousness beyond. As the chakras are opened, the astral body is gradually dissolved. While we can correlate physical and subtle body components and functions, we should realize that the two are not the same, and the spiritually opened astral body is yet something more, resembling more a mist of ener­ gies spreading beyond the galaxies than something we can de­ The chakras are part of a much higher energy system than the physical body. To make a helpful analogy: activating each chakra requires doubling the amount of energy required for sustaining all ordinary body and brain functions. It requires about twice the energy to activate the first, the root or earth chakra, than the energy reqUired for sustaining our ordinary psychophysical functions, twice that amount to activate the next chakra, and so on up to the top of the head. So there is a greater change of consciousness between chakras than from the ordinary human consciousness to the first awakened chakra. 142 Yoga and Ayurveda For the chakras to come into function depends upon a higher source of energy than the physical body can provide.

This occurs when the prana is withdrawn from its fixation on the external world and removed from our sensory involvement. As long as tions, it cannot come into the central channel. For this reason, the arousing of the kundalini involves a state of samadhi in which we leave ordinary consciousness. In the beginning this is experienced in a condition of trance in which we becorrie unconscious of the physical body Later it can occur in the waking state, without an impairment of physical action, but the physi­ cal body is no longer experienced as one's true identity Developing the awakened prana or kundalini energy greatly enhances one's skill and power as a healer. Kundalini is the very healing power of the Divine Mother that connects with cosmic life and love and its curative power. Such a healer can heal by mere touch, by their voice or by their presen ce. For this reason we should be careful not to try to manipulate this subtle pranic force but let the divine direct it for us. It is best to meditate upon the Divine Mother as wielding the pranic healing force, not ourselves personally Power is always a temptation for the ego and, as kundalini is perhaps the greatest power, the The opened chakras afford access to the cosmic functions of their respective elements and faculties. They give knowledge tive constituents of the universe . When the chakras are opened we experience the cosmic nature of these factors as part of our own deeper awareness . We learn the secrets of creation and As we awaken our subtle energies and faculties, we may experience subtle sounds, lights, or visions of deities in the region of the third eye. But such experiences may come long before any particular chakra is opened. To bring the subtle cen­ ters into function, the gross or physical centers must be put in state of rest or eqUilibrium. That is why the practices of yoga develop stillness of body, breath, senses and mind, particularly through pratyahara as the basis for working with the chakras. Kundalini is a force of withdrawa l, reversing the process of creation so that we can return to the One. Therefore it cannot function unless we reduce external involvement and attachments. To properly develop the earth chakra requires detachment from the earth element. One no longer seeks to accumulate matter outwardly but learns to appreciate it inwardly as a form of per­ ception. One learns to enjoy the colors, textures, and shadows of the earth element like a display of magnificent mountains within the mind, but one has no desire to possess or hold To properly open the water chakra is different than having quires that the physical sexual organ goes into a state of latency and the sexual drive is sublimated into a force of awareness. One learns to enjoy the flow and flavor of the water element as a movement of delight, riding on the waves of perception in To properly open the fire chakra does not involve increas­ ing one's personal will or determination. It requires awakening must oneself become a fire and burn all the impurities within the body and mind. It is like experiencing the fire that destroys the universe at the end of the cycle of the yugas, in which our To open the heart or air chakra is quite different than to be in a heightened, vulnerable or open emotional state. To awaken the heart chakra we must go beyond personal emotions and understand the cosmic ene rgy of love behind all emotional fluc­ tuations. This requires an opening to the universal feelings of compassion and devotion, and contact with the universal life­ force. It is an experience of pure devotion, becoming love itself. To open the throat or ether chakra is not a matter of height­ ened speech or expression but of being silent in the expanse of cosmic space, in which our personal voice is lost in the divine Word. It is merging into the cosmic ether in which the essence Opening the third eye requires learning to live as pure in­ sight, not requiring a body or even senses. Opening the crown . chakra means becoming one with the infinite, eternal nature of The awakening of the consciousness behind the subtle body involves being able to take off the gross body and its functions like a heavy overcoat which is no longer necessary on a warm summer day. This can be frightening to those attached to the body, but it is delightful to those who do not perceive life in Kundalini and the Chakras 145 Each chakra provides an awareness of corresponding levels The corresponding sub planes of the astral universe , which are quite marvelous beyond anything in the physical world, may become available to the third eye. Beautiful astral moun­ tains may be seen, vast expanses of translucent astral oceans, scintillating astral suns and pulsating astral stars. One may ride the astral winds through various worlds, or expand one's mind through endless astral spaces and their many universes of beauty and delight. One can meet with sages and deities or with friends from former lives, renewing soul connections. In the higher chakras one can gain access to causal realms of pure inSight, ideal perception, and endless awareness beyond personal limi­ tation. One can visit the workshop of creation and see how the Yet not all yogis choose to explore the worlds or the facul­ ties that relate to the chakras. Many great jnanis, or yogiS of the path of knowledge , strive to merge directly into pure unity or the Absolute, which is beyond both subtle and causal bodies. In their awakening they may hardly note the distinctions of the chakras and their functions. From their experience such as that of Ramana Maharshi, who perhaps most typifies this view the heart, from which all the phenomenon of the gross and subtle worlds and bodies appear like images seen in a mirror tees simply seek to merge in God or Bhagavan in the heart and are not concerned with the various experiences of the chakras, even when these are known to them. These are very high states that few can approach, but we must recognize that the chakras are a series of stages rather than an end in themselves, and can Yogic literature speaks of various siddhis or psychic pow­ ers. These relate primarily to the subtle body and its pranas, as subtle matter is totally malleable .

We should not regard any extraordinary experience as enlightenment or as a kundalini ing, mystical dreams, genius, inspiration of various sorts and other such states, even if legitimate , may still fall short of the real awakening of the kundalini and certainly should not be ment of our awareness rather than giving ourselves over to some To properly open the chakras requires divine grace. It can­ not be done willfully or forcefully arrived at from a state of Kundalini and the Chakras 147 emotional disturbance . Attempts to awaken kundalini without having first purified the body and mind lead to side effects in illusory experiences arise. For this reason, traditional yogic lit­ erature has always stressed right living factors and right atti­ lifestyle regimens, as the basis for kundalini practices. While it is possible to have aberrant kundalini or chakra experiences, most of these are pranic or mental disturbances. If the mind is not purified there can be a heightened activity of the lower chakras, along with an increase in their correspond­ ing physical and emotional urges. For this reason we should seek to work on the lower chakras from the standpoint of the In addition to the seven higher chakras, there are seven lower chakras beneath the muladhara which relate to the underworld, that work to keep us in ignorance and illusion. It is possible to fall into these lower chakras and their negative experiences of If we approach the chakras carefully and with the right gUid­ ance, we have nothing to fear, but it is better to be overly cau­ tious rather than too daring while working with these lightning­ like forces.

I 1 yurveda views the body as a collection of channels from the great channel that is the gastrointestinal tract to the btle channels of the nervous system. Yoga similarly According to the Vedic view, Vayu, the cosmic air force, creates all these channels. Vayu is called sutratman, the Self or Atman of the sutra, meaning a thread, channel or canal. The channels created by Vayu hold all things in the universe like gems on a string. Just as there are channels in the body, so external nature is filled with various channels from rivers and streams to currents of energy in intergalactic space. In this section we will discuss the channels of the mind and the subtle body. General books on Ayurveda can be consulted for infor­ The mind has its own single nadi or channel called chitta nadi or the channel of consciousness. Ayurveda refers to its physical counterpart as manovaha strotas, the channel that car­ ries thought. All of us have experienced the flow of the mind, the flow of thought or the stream of consciousness . This is the Chitta nadi originates in the spiritual heart, the site of the reincarnating soul or individual Self, Jivatman . In the heart re­ sides our connection with the Creator from which the chitta nadi gains energy. The core impulses arising from our deeper mind or heart, our samskaras, propel the movement through Chitta nadi is the flow of our samskaras from the heart to the outer world. It moves upward first to the throat, from which our expression comes out, and then to the head where it gets connected with the senses and external objects. Then it flows back down from the head to the throat and back to the heart. This is the twofold flow of the chitta nadi. First it has a move­ ment out toward the external world, which is from the heart up to the head and out through the senses. Then it has a contrary movement from the outer world of the senses to the inner world of the psyche, which is down from the head into the heart. The outward flow of the chitta nadi gives rise to the outer mind, emotions, and life urges, what Samkhya calls the field of manas and the subtle body. The inner flow of the chitta nadi gives rise to the inner mind and intuition, what Samkhya calls buddhi or inner intelligence.27 The outward flow follows the movement of the cosmic repulSive force or ignorance. The in­ ward flow reflects the movement of divine attraction. The out­ ward flow of chitta nadi brings us into the body and creates the waking state, which is dominated by sensory activity in the The Nadis: The Cannel Systems of Mind and Prana 151 head. The inner flow of the chitta nadi takes us into our own consciousness and creates the states of dream and deep sleep. Dream occurs in the throat region. Deep sleep occurs at the At death, the chitta nadi flows inward, as in sleep, taking and hell worlds. The tunnel experiences that people common ly In the ordinary human mind, the flow through the chitta nadi is restricted and broken up. Our minds are distracted and fragmented and move in various directions. Nevertheless there remains some consistency to the flow through the mind chan­ tification of the self with the body generates the external flow of chitta nadi. The recognition of the Self as pure consciousness self, we get trapped in the outer mind, emotions and senses. As we expand our sense of self from the personal to the universal, the flow in chitta nadi increases. When the chitta nadi flows freely it completes its circuit and returns to the heart. In the practice of meditation one can experience this qUicker, freer and more consistent flow through chitta nadi. Once the flow be­ comes completely liberated, it merges us back into the ocean of consciousness that dwells within the heart; the free flow be­ Ego causes various toxins, impurities or heavy matters These toxins derive from wrongly digested food, impressions and associations, from wrong diet, wrong use of the senses, The Nadis: The Cannel Systems of Mind and Prana 153 and wrong relationshi ps. Hence the flow through the chitta nadi is affected by the condition of the body, prana and mind. Chitta nadi is connected to all the channel systems of the physical and occur. These knots are the constrictions in the flow of the chitta, blockages in the flow of vayu or prana in the mind space. Our samskaras, deep desires or impulses inhibit the flow of energy from the Self through the chitta nadi and get projected into the external world as various limited ego identities. Opening the spiritual heart and opening the chitta nadi are thus the same. Along with the chitta nadi, related peripheral subtle nadis open, bringing an experience of bliss into the physical body itself. In fact the mind is not different from its flow. The vibration When the mind comes to a state of calm and silence, then the flow of the mind channel also becomes calm, merging into peace, Chitta nadi is the channel of the causal body, the field of the deeper mind and heart. From it arises the original prana of the soul that is the basis of all life. Chitta nadi, therefore, is the original pranic flow as well as that of the mind. The movement channel functioning. It is most intimately related to the sushumna, the governing channel of the subtle bo dy, and to the kundalini , the serpent power which is the awakened flow of energy through the sushumna. The free flow through the chitta nadi causes the kundalini to flow through the sushumna as well. Chitta nadi 154 Yoga and Ayurveda relates to the upper regions of the sushumna from the heart to Chitta nadi governs not only the flow of thought but also the flow of prana that derives from it. The sushumna as the higher pranic nadi is closely connected with the chitta nadi or channel of the mind in its awakened flow. When the chitta nadi flows outward, the kundalini remains asleep or dormant. When chitta nadi flows within, then kundalini awakens and begins to move. The inward flow of the chitta nadi leads to the purification and energization of all the other nadis, leading to the opening of the chakras and their potentials. However, not all yogis will experience all the chakras and their energies. Some may go di­ rectly to the heart and not concern themselves with the other The flow of chitta nadi is desire based. Desire causes the chitta nadi to flow outward. Detachment allows it to flow within. As sexual desire is the strongest desire, it has the greatest out­ ward pull on this channel. As the chitta nadi flows outward, our energy gets directed to the external world, where it is even­ tually lost. As it flows within, our energy gets directed within works to inhibit the outward flow through chitta nadi so that the inward flow can be dev eloped. Dharana is the concentra­ tion of energy in the chitta nadi through directed attention. Meditation occurs when the energy flows continuous ly through chitta nadi. Samadhi occurs when the chitta nadi flows without obstruction. Perhaps the best method is to follow the current knowledge. Another way is to worship God in the heart in whatever form appeals to us. Mantra or anything else that cre­ ates a constant stream of higher thoughts helps open chitta nadi. The Nadis: The Cannel Systems of Mind and Prana 155 Anything that expands our consciousness will similarly cause ticularly its higher practices, aims at developing the chitta nadi. Among the doshas, the chitta nadi is most closely related to vata, owing to vata's connection with prana and with the mind. Mind, prana and vata move together. Vata aggravation brings about abnormal or disturbed flow through the chitta nadi. However, kapha as attachment can block its flow. Pitta as anger similarly can agitate its flow. Relative to the three vital essences, prana arises through the free flow of chitta nadi. Tejas is its light power. Ojas is the stability of its flow. tions. Of them, three determine the primary energy flows and The most important and central of these nadis is called the sushumna or astral spine. It is located in the spinal canal in the physical body It controls all the functions of various chakras that are placed like lotuses upon it. The sushumna is sattvic in nature and becomes activated by the awakened kundalini or prana shakti. Otherwise its energy flow is very limited. The ida and pingala along with the sushumna are the three most important nadis. When the sushumna is not awakened, the energy flows through one of these two channels alternately, which complement each other in their work. They run to the left and right of the sushumna like two interwoven spirals from 156 Yoga and Ayurveda its origin at the base of the spine to the region of the third eye, The ida is the left nadi. It has a lunar, feminine, cooling or kapha energy and is tamasic in quality Ida provides inspiration of vision, speech and imagination and elevates our devotional inclinations, making us more caring and lOving. The pingala is the right nadi. It has a solar, masculine, heating or pitta energy and is rajasic in quality Pingala prOvides motivation, drive, and determination and allows us to pursue deeper knowledge and Normally our energy flows more in one nadi than the other, which we can determine by examining the nostril through which the breath is mainly flOwing. In this regard the two nadis relate to right and left brain functioning. Left brain functioning relates to the opposite or right nadi and makes us rational, indepen­ dent and aggressive. Right brain functioning relates to the op­ posite or left nadi and makes us emotional, sensitive and re­ ceptive. When the breath is more in the left nostril, the right brain and its functions get activated. When it is more on the right side, the left brain and its functions are promoted. in the solar and lunar nadis is equalized, then the kundalini awakens and the prana enters the sushumna. This brings the subtle body into function and takes us into a higher state of mind and perception. The key to health of the subtle body lies in balancing the flow of energy through these two nadis. Note the chapter on pranayama for more information in this regard. If we try to awaken the kundalini or open the chakras while the nadis are not balanced, we can drive subtle toxic substances into the sushumna or into the ida and pingala. The. kundalini moving into the ida will cause false imaginations and distorted emotions, an overly passive mind, along with a possible loss of consciousness to other entities.

Eight nadis follow the rightlleft predominance of the ida",

The alambusha is the next most important channel after The channels can be treated through the senses, organs of action or systems of the body that apply to them, as well as by treating the chakras from which they branch off. A good method is to visualize these channels and direct the flow of prana through them via thought, viewing the prana as red or orange in color. Learning to visualize the nadis and the flow of energy through them is an important method of pranayama and pratyahara . The channels can also be treated through pranayama in which the flow of prana is directed along them via visualizati on. Note this Note that this section describes various practices relative to the doshic types of vata, pitta and kapha. If one is a combination of these types the rule to remember is to treat the dosha that is currently out of balance. • • ood, anna, is the first Sanskrit word for Brahman, the Supreme Godhead. Everything in the universe is food. The inner Self, Atman, is the eater of the food which is everything. All that we see is food for the soul. Our develop­ ment as a soul depends upon our ability to eat and digest the food that is our life. Food, anna, is the basis of life, prana. It The type of food that we seek reflects our level of develop­ ment. From the nature of the food that a person chooses, his or her stage of consciousness is revealed. Yoga and Ayurveda emphasize a pure vegetarian or what is called a sattvic diet a diet to encourage the development of sattva, the higher quali­ ties of peace, love and awareness . Eating is our first interaction with our environme nt. If that is not based upon love and com­ passion, all our other actions are bound to suffer. Ayurveda emphasizes right diet as the foundation of all heal­ ing therapies. Food is the first and most important form of medicine . Without right food no other healing modality can be effective. Ayurveda recommends sattvic or pure food because sattva creates balance, eliminates harmful factors and helps re­ Sattvic diet is first of all vegetarian , avoiding any products that involve killing or harming of animals. Sattvic diet additionally emphasizes natural foods, foods grown in harmony with na­ ture, on good soils, ripened naturally , cooked in the right man­ ner and with the right attitude of love. Such foods are carriers Yogis are among the strictest people in the world about their diets. Not only are they vegetarian, they avoid commercially prepared food, fried food, and fast food. They refrain from eggs and garlic as well. Yogis commonly cook their own food or travel with their own cooks, who know the art of sattvic cook­ ing. If you invite such a real yogi over to your house, he or she may show you how to cook, probably first going to the store and making sure to have all the right food articles and then preparing a wonderful meal that becomes almost a sacrament. However, a yogic diet has a different purpose than an ayurvedic diet and the two should not simply be equated. This reflects the different purposes of the two disciplines: Ayurveda aims at bringing health and balance to the physical body; yoga aims at helping us transcend body consciousness. While Ayurveda works to improve bodily health, yoga helps us move beyond bodily limitations. For this reason, most traditional yogic diSciplines are ascetic in nature, including fasting and light diet, raw foods and detoxification measures, as well as sensory dep­ rivation, pranayama and meditation. All these factors not only tend to reduce physical consciousness but can aggravate vata, nature. Traditional Ayurveda, on the other hand, emphasizes cooked foods, nutritive diet, and protecting ourselves from the Yogic and Ayurvedic Diets 169 elements in order to build physical strength and prevent the A lot of confusion exists today about the role of raw food diets in yoga and Ayurveda, and in vegetarianism in general. Some people identify vegetarian diet with raw food only. Cooking vegetables does not turn them into meat! Vegetarian diet in­ Many food items, like rice or potatoes, have to be cooked in Ayurveda generally does not recommend raw food diets for long term health maintenance but only for short term detoxifi­ cation. This is because raw food is harder to digest and does not prOvide as much bulk nutrition as cooked food. Ayurveda recommends specific diets to counter our dosha. These are based mainly on whole grains, beans, root vegetables, seeds and nuts, with only secondary amounts of raw food items what could be called \"balanced\" or \"nutritive\" vegetarian diets. This ayurvedic view that cooked food is better, however, has caused some people to think that raw food is bad from an ayurvedic perspecti ve. Because of the connection between Ayurveda and yoga, these individuals may consider that raw food diets are unyogic. However, if we look at traditional yogic texts we do find an emphasis on raw food. Yogic diet is tradi­ includes grains and dairy products as well. Yogis in retreat in nature live on wild food as part of their spiritual regimen and as a means of connecting with the forces of nature. Raw foods, we should note, increase the air and ether ele­ ments in the body and mind, the vata components. Cooked foods are better for increasing earth and water elements, the 170 Yoga and Ayurveda kapha components, and also for increasing fire, the pitta factor. This makes cooked foods easier to digest and better to build the body, but raw food better for promoting our subtle sensi­ A yogic diet emphasizes the development of air and ether elements, not only for detoxification but also for opening the mind, whose nature is mainly air and ether. For this reason it recommends raw foods as well as fasting. RedUcing the body allows the mind to develop and expand, lowering our body Yogic diet considers not only the role of the doshas, which is the main factor in ayurvedic diet, but the role of prana. Raw foods are rich in prana, which the yogi is seeking to develop as the higher energy of the mind. Raw food bring the pranic force not only into the body but into the mind as well. Raw food is part of a traditional yogic diet for cleansing of the nadis or the channels, which occurs through increasing prana. Great yogis were said to be able to live on the air or prana alone. Others could live on only water, yet others on a little fruit, milk or through internal practices so that vata does not get aggravated in the practice of yoga. The correct practice of yoga, particularly pranayama, increases agni so that we are able to digest raw foods. With a higher internal heat we are not so dependent upon heat in our food and do better with a cooling diet. The yogi with a stronger digestive and pranic fire can handle raw foods, temperature extremes and other physical imbalances that ordinarily cause disease. Ayurveda, however, aims at the ordi­ nary person who requires protection from these external vicis­ rarely ascetics, may not have the digestive power to handle raw Yogic and Ayurvedic Diets 171 food items, particularly for long periods of time. This is espe­ cially true of vata types who usually have a weak or variable tential of a traditional yogic diet. But kapha people with their low digestive fire and slow metabolism can be weakened by too much raw food as well. Even pitta types will find raw food Yet most people can benefit from periodic raw food diets for detoxification purposes, particular ly in late springtime , April or May depending upon the climate, which is the natural sea­ son for detoxification. We also require some amount of raw food in our diets, generally about ten or twenty percent, to afford the proper vitamins, minerals and enzymes that abound in these foods. Good raw food items to take with meals are cucumbers, radishes, carrots, tomatoes, and various types of In addition, those who want to cleanse not only the physi­ cal body but the subtle body can do so with the aid of raw food diets combined with asana, pranayama, mantra and medi­ tation. Such a practice can be done for one to three months depending upon one's constitution. Anyone who seriously wants to go into yoga practice should consider such preliminary detoxi­ fication approaches, particularly as allied with the ayurvedic detoxification program of pancha karma. As most people in the West are overweight and have many toxins in their systems, these detoxification methods are often the first measures in re­ To avoid the danger of over detoxification with raw foods there is a simple test. Raw food diets should not serve to sup­ press our digestive fire, leaving us without a healthy appetite to sustain us. Along with the raw food diet, try to follow a regi­ men to increase the digestive fire with the use of spices like 172 Yoga and Ayurveda ginger, cayenne, cinnamon and basil, or the ayurvedic formula trikatu. One should only take raw food to the extent that one's digestive fire has the capacity Nevertheless, the importance of raw food for purification should not be overlooked. As one advances in spiritual practices, one can handle more raw food Advanced yogis naturally gravitate toward raw foods, as well as grains and dairy products. They prefer living on pranic foods to anything processed or overcooked, and may ultimately give up cooked food altogether. Seeing nature as their mother, they dislike commercially prepared or grown food. Spiritual progress reflects a growing sensitivity to food and requires food that contains both prana and love as the main ingredients. reduce, if not avoid altogether. This is particula rly true of red first of the yamas or lifestyle disciplines of yoga practice. If our yoga practice is based upon harming other creatures it cannot The human body, teeth and digestive system are that of a vegetarian animal. Vegetable foods provide the ideal nutrition to build up our human sensitivities through a refined physical and astral body We cannot readily break down animal tissues into the right components for human tissue. Instead of digest­ ing and transforming meat into the appropriate human tissue, its animal energies are preserved and become substituted for Meat increases the animal fire in the body, bringing the samskaras or tendencies of carnivorous animals to function Yogic and Ayurvedic Diets 173 within us. This promotes anger, lust and fear and other nega­ tive emotions. The flame created by a meat diet is impure and projects an emotional smoke that distorts the mind and the nervous system. Meat diet communicates the energy of destruc­ tion to the cells, which in turn promotes processes of disease and decay within them. It brings in a subtle energy of death into the auric field, redUcing the flow of higher pranas into the body The lives of the creatures we have eaten weigh down the astral body with their negative feelings and impressions . Meat produces a heavy or tamasic type of tissue that clogs the channels and tends to make the mind dull. This does not mean that spiritual practices will have no effect for a meat eater but that if these are successful, which is less likely, there is a danger that the meat in the system, which is a crude form of fuel, may cause the person to overheat or create a kind of smoke that distorts any higher experiences. Not only violence and crime but religiOUS intolerance has historically been more common among· meat­ eating groups. This is not just a moral but an energetic issue for body, mind and spirit on both individual and collective levels. If we add the damage that meat consumption is doing to the planet through the destruction of the rain forests, pollution of land and water, and the increasing difficulty of sustaining a meat of this problem cannot be glossed over. We cannot truly evolve as a species and go beyond war and crime until we give up eating Many people today are not strict vegetarians but eat chicken and fish as well. While this animal flesh is less harmful than red meat, it is still the life of another living and moving crea­ ture. Not only are these food articles harmful for yogic practice, they are harmful for the planet and for other creatures. The amount of chickens raised today in factory farms is in the many Even vegetarians who do not eat whole eggs may consume many eggs in other food products. Eggs are common ingredients in breads, pastries, noodles, mayonnaise, and salad dressings. Avoiding eggs can be difficult, even if one does not take them directly. One must carefully look at the label of foods to see if eggs are included. While eating eggs causes less harm than eat­ ing fish, chicken or red meat, eggs are still animal flesh and cause exploitation to these creatures. Many Hindu temples do not allow those who eat eggs into their inner sanctuaries. The complications of factory farming and genetic engineering to Unfortunatel y, many yoga students and even yoga teachers in the West partake of meat diets, sometimes serving chicken and fish at yoga or meditation retreats. How this can be ig­ nored, given the dharmic traditions of ahimsa, is hard to un­ derstand, particularly when vegetarian items are easy to get. Right diet is not just a question of food type but food qual­ ity. The quality of food in our culture is generally low, as most of us have come to know. If food is God, then our God is certainly dead, or at least he has become little more than a bUsi­ ness arrangement for maximum profit! Our food is mass pro­ duced, mass prepared and mass consumed, with little care or attention and certainly little love or consciousness. Poor food quality begins with bad soils, chemical fertilizers, and the use of insecticides and herbicides on the plants, the long term ef­ fects of which are unknown . Poor food quality is compounded by premature picking, artificial ripening, long transportation and refrigeration that often eliminates whatever real vitality managed to survive in the plant. On top of this comes the processing of Yogic and Ayurvedic Diets 175 food, which may include irradiation, freezing and canning, along with additives and preservatives of all types. As if this was not enough, our cooking procedures involve microwave ovens, over­ cooking, and an excess use of oils, sugar, salt and spices. The result is that we don't so much eat our food as our food eats us, providing not so much nourishment as a breeding ground Yet however bad this situation may be, it is likely to get worse. Genetic engineering is now adding genes from bacteria, viruses, other plants and animals to food crops. Even the seeds that we use to grow our plants are becoming genetically modi­ fied. There are bacteria, nut and flower genes in soybeans. Fish and pig genes are being added to tomatoes. The main reason for such changes is to make the food look better, last longer, or become more resistant to herbicides and pesticides so that these can be used more abundantly , not to actually make the food Such genetic changes are unlikely to be mentioned on la­ bels. Already most of the soybeans grown are genetically engi­ neered, making it difficult for vegetarians since soybeans are common in most vegetarian products. Naturally, for anyone trying to follow a pure yogic diet, such changes are distressing. Since we cannot avoid eating and, if we travel at all, may be forced to eat out, we can only hope to reduce the amount of bad food This modern food dilemma is forcing all of us to become more conscious of our diets. We must learn to grow our own food, to support local and organic gardeners, and to become politically active on environmental matters. Food is the sacred root of life. If we compromise it we are only jeopardizing our own health and happiness. Unfortunately the coming century stands to inherit not only bad food, but bad water and bad air as well. We can at least get good bottled water. The air and 176 Yoga and Ayurveda food are more precarious. Therefore, raising our food conscious­ ness and food discrimination is an important part of any eco­ A true yogi should be among those in the forefront work­ ing for protection of animals and protection of the Earth. If we act now there is still much that we can do to improve if not fundamentally alter these negative conditions. The Earth itself, like the human body, has tremendous powers of revitalization if we learn to facilitate this healing force to operate without our The yoga traditions of India regard dairy products as excel­ lent foods, particularly for individuals on the spiritual path. While dairy is not recommended for all types, particularly not for kaphas, it has an important role not only for maintaining health but for promoting longevity Ancient Vedic civilization grew up around the cow, which provided milk, cream, butter, and yogurt. Throughout history, these foods have been favor­ ites of the yogis who did not find dairy products harmful to their health. In his childhood, the great avatar Krishna was no­ torious for helping himself to the freshly churned butter any Ayurveda uses dairy preparations medicinal ly, particularly for improving resistance to disease, and to promote convales­ cence and regenerati on. These include milk decoctions, medi­ ommended for the young, but for the elderly and for anyone who is debilitated or needing strength. Many yogis take to a predominantly milk diet for extended periods of time. Freshly boiled milk, with spices and raw sugar, is considered to be an However, this depends upon good quality milk from cows Yogic and Ayurvedic Diets 177 who have been treated well, which takes us back to our mod­ em dilemma. Such milk is rarely available commercially. Other­ wise, poorly prepared dairy products from badly treated cows increases mucus in the system and promotes food and sinus There are a number of health issues relating to milk prod­ ucts that we must understand in order to use dairy correctly. Some people lack the enzymes necessary to digest dairy prod­ ucts because their ethnic group has no history of taking dairy. with it. Other problems arise not from dairy products them­ selves but from their improper preparation . Just as whole wheat flour is quite different from bleached white flour, so naturally­ prepared dairy products are quite distinct from dairy products In India the cow is allowed to give its milk to its calf first. Only the leftover milk, which is often considerab le, is taken by humans. If the calf is taken away from its mother, her milk loses much of its nourishing quality. The dairy industry re­ moves calves from their mothers and slaughters them. We kill the animal's child and then drink its milk. How would a hu­ man mother feel under such circumstances? When a cow hears the call of her calf, she immediately begins to secrete milk. The cow knows when her calf is going to be killed, and her dis­ Cows are mistreated in many other ways, including being confined to pens and milked by machine s. They are now hybrid animals, produced through artificial inseminatio n, genetical ly redesigned to produce far more milk than is healthy for them to do. They are fed hormones, antibiotics and inorganic grains. Chemical residues are absorbed into their tissues and concen­ trated in their milk. Pasteurizatio n, homogenization and long term refrigeration of dairy products also weaken their benefits. 178 Yoga and Ayurveda Ayurvedic texts explains the properties of various dairy prod­ ucts in great detail. They tell us that the quality of meat or dairy products from tethered or confined animals is much less than that from animals who are able to graze freely. Hence we cannot equate modern factory farm dairy products with those of ayurvedic texts. Clearly we should try to get raw or organic dairy products, or be careful in using dairy products at all. Of dairy products, milk and ghee are excellent for the prac­ tice of yoga. Milk is best taken freshly boiled with spices like ginger, cinnamon and cardamom. Yogurt is better if mixed with Most cheeses are made with rennet that comes from cow intestine s. Strict vegetarians therefore only use cheese that has been produced with vegetarian enzymes. Such cheeses are now available in most natural food stores. Also cottage cheese, cream As most Indian cooking is very spicy, some people assume that a yogic diet must have a lot of spices, including much cayenne or chilies. This is not the case. People raised on high spice diets, like those raised in India, can tolerate more of these, even on a yogic diet. However, a yogic diet should not be too spicy because most spices are rajasic and irritate the nerves. It should emphasize sweet spices like ginger, cinnamo n, carda­ Many spicy foods, particularly in restaurants , are prepared with bad oils. This is not a good combination. If you take a high spice diet you should make sure that you are using good quality natural spices along with good quality natural oils like ganic butter rather than from regular commercial butter. Some people are of the opinion that any spiritual diet should avoid sugar altogether. This is mainly owing to the dangers caused by white sugar. White sugar is a processed and refined food and should be avoided for this reason. Yet we all require a certain amount of natural sugars, like honey or unrefined sugar children. So too, as the kundalini develops through spiritual practice, pure sugars may be required to keep the metabolism in balance. For this reason natural sweets in moderation are To follow a sattvic diet we must understand the six tastes. Sweet is the primary sattvic taste because it is nourishing, bal­ ancing and agreeable to the mind and senses. However, by sweet taste Ayurveda means natural sweets, not processed sugars, much less artificial sweeteners. It includes sugars, starches, carbohy­ drates and oils, such as those found in fruit, grains, vegetables, Pungent, sour and salty tastes tend to be rajasic because they are stimulating in properties. While this makes them good for improving digestion and other therapeutic qualities, it makes them potentially irritating to the nervous system. Pungent or spicy taste has a hot and expansive nature that can push our energies too far if used in excess, causing depletion. Salt can clog the arteries and channels because of its mineral content, like the salts that corrode plumbing pipes. Sour taste, like alco­ Bitter and astringent tastes tend to be tamasic because their 180 Yoga and Ayurveda long term reducing effects, which, however useful for detoxifi­ cation and weight reduction, have potential side effects. Bitter taste, with its cold and light properties, has a detoxifying effect Astringent taste, which is constricting, can result in the reten­ Yet each taste can be sattvic, rajasic or tamasic depending on how it is used. It is a question of proportions. We need the right balance of all six tastes. This consists of a predominately sweet taste diet, with the use of pungent, salty, and sour articles as condiments , and the use of bitter and astringent tastes for Too much sweet food, even of a natural type, becomes tamasic or dulling and can clog the channels . Artificially pre­ pared or processed sweets tend to do this in any quantit y. Sweet spices, like ginger, cinnamon and mint are sattvic, as is sour fruit like lemon and lime. Some bitter herbs, like gotu kola, are sattvic because bitter taste with its air and ether elements helps expand the mind. Overeating of any food type can become tamasic and cause stagnation. On the other hand, undereating or taking a too light or too stimulating diet increases rajas. Only the right diet and proper food quantity is sattvic. Sattvic diet is pleasant but evenly balanced in taste, containing some Yogic and Ayurvedic Diets 181 amount of all six tastes and only taken in the amount necessary Ayurveda prescribes dietary regimens for the different doshas. In this regard, three tastes decrease and three tastes increase each of the doshas as described in the table above. A number of good ayurvedic cookbooks exist for those interested in go­ Ayurvedic cooking and dietetic approaches are mainly con­ cerned with physical health and do not always address the is­ sue of sattva. Hence they may discuss certain food types that are not sattvic in nature. Yoga, on the other hand, emphasizing a sattvic diet, may include foods that can aggravate certain doshas. For an optimal dietary regimen one should combine a sattvic diet with a diet appropriate for one's doshic type. Abundant sattvic foods exist for all constitutions. One can take the list of sattvic foods given below and adjust it relative to the foods for Sattvic diet is a matter of timing of meals as well as food morning or in the evening as it is more likely to clog the sys­ tem at these times. The morning meal should be light and stimu­ lating. The main meal should be at noon, followed by a period of rest or relaxation , or in the early evening. Eating late at night, except some light food like fruit or milk, weighs the body and One should also remember the particular imbalances that are likely through yogic practices. As yogic practices like pranayama and meditation are more likely to aggravate vata, so tices. Note also the information on ojas in the earlier chapter 182 Yoga and Ayurveda Yogic diet is not simply a sattvic diet but a pranic diet, full of the vital force needed to energize the mind and subtle body. In this regard different foods relate to the different pranas. Of the five pranas, pranic foods are mainly green leafy veg­ etables and sprouts that grow qUickly, particularly in the spring­ time when prana is abundant. These are stimulating, cooling and purifying. Raw food diets with many chlorophyll domi­ nant foods and herbs promote prana, particula rly if combined with mild aromatic spices like ginger, coriander or mint. Apanic foods are foods that grow beneath the earth, mainly root vegetables like potatoes, carrots and sweet potatoes. They includes mushrooms, which arise out of the earth. Such foods increase strength, endurance and ojas but can be a little heavy. As the soul or jiva in plants dwells in the ground, roots can contain great vital energy. This category includes special power­ ful root herbs like ginseng or shatavari, including tonics to the Samana foods are mainly whole grains which have a bal­ whole grains should be the foundation of most diets. Dairy products, which are predigested foods, come under samana as well, as does honey and raw sugars. Such foods are nourishing but not heavy, unless taken in excess, and easy to digest. Vyana foods are those which spread on the ground like squash, melons, strawberries, tomatoes and beans. These are strengthening and stimulating and help our energy expand. They are usually taken along with grains or samana foods. Udana foods are fruit and nuts that grow above in trees. They contain more of the ether element and nourish the deeper Yogic and Ayurvedic Diets 183 mind and heart. They can be taken by themselves and are very Yoga emphasizes foods with sattvic prana. This is most commonly found in foods produced above the ground like fruit and nuts. Foods that grow on the ground, like tomatoes or strawberr ies, have a tendency to develop rajas. Food that grow or develop from beneath the ground tend to tamas, like garlic, onions and mushrooms. But these are only secondary factors. Sattvic roots and vegetables are quite common as well. to help make our prana rise, and samana foods, like rice and milk, to keep us in balance, but food for the other pranas is also good. We should make sure to have foods for all the five While taking pranic foods one must be careful to keep one's doshas in balance. Vata types need nour ishing food that strength­ ens apana and so require more root vegetables or root herbs. All doshic types benefit from foods that relate to samana, like whole grains, which are balancing in nature. In addition, spices may be required to strengthen the digestive fire and the fire of ture like pranic foods tend to be. Prana dominates in air and ether elements and so needs the heat of fire, the grounding of earth, and the moistening quality of water to keep it in balance. • Fruit of all types, particularly of a sweet nature, taken fresh • All vegetables, except too much onions and garlic • Whole grains of all types, particularly rice, wheat and oats • Beans in moderation, except those that are not too heavy in properties, like mung, aduki or tofu 184 Yoga and Ayurveda • Nuts and seeds like almond, coconut, walnuts, pecans, and • Dairy products from cows who have been treated well, • Sweet spices like ginger, cinnamon, cardamom, fennel, • Canned food, except naturally canned fruit and tomatoes • Any overly cooked foods, old, stale or recooked food • Food taken in a disturbed environment or eaten too the best for the fulfillment of the heart's desire. erbs are powerful aids in the practice of yoga. They are useful not only for treating diseases and for rejuve­ nation but for awakening all our higher faculties. Any­ one involved in yoga should consider taking helpful herbs on a regular basis. Yogis commonly have taken herbs to aid in their practice and to stimulate both prana and the higher mind. Many of the oriental tonic herbs becoming popular in this country today, like ginseng and ashwagandha, are excellent for yoga practice because they increase our deeper vital energies erties for the muscles and nerves, especially helpful for vegetar­ ians who may need a deeper form of nutrition. But even com­ monly available herbs and spices like ginger, turmeric or licorice have value for yoga practice. Herbs are important adjuncts that can catalyze processes that otherwise may be difficult to achieve. We can all benefit from a daily usage of herbs. Our daily herbs may be as important as our daily bread. The effects of herbs, however, do not manifest immediately Like food, the benefits from herbs accrue over time and require the right diet and lifestyle regimens to support them. For this reason, we must give herbs the proper circumstances in which to work and not simply treat them like drugs. Note that this chapter will not discuss the background of ayurvedic herbolog y, the preparation of herbs or related issues. These can be found in other books on Ayurveda.29 We will focus on relevant herbs According to the Vedic view, the sap of herbs contains an powerful life essence called soma. The soma from plants can body, and boost it to a higher level of activity This healing creating a superior fotm of plasma to nurture and rejuvenate other tissues. It creates an exhilarating effect that promotes healing Some botanists have looked for an original soma plant, as if soma was only a Single herb. They are making a mistake. Vedic texts mention many different types of soma plants, and soma is the essence of all plants. They commonly equate soma of plants through their pollen. Soma, therefore, refers to vari­ plants than others but exist throughout the plant kingdom. Classical ayurvedic texts like the Susruta Samhlta mention soma substitute, particula rly by the ancient Persians who fol­ lowed a similar religion to the Vedic Hindus. Soma is a general are most common in tonic and nervine herbs. Traditionally in India, various members of the lily and orchid family were used for this purpose because of their strong nutritive and nervine Soma ingredients are most prevalent among plants growing in the mountains, particularly by streams and lakes.

      "description": "Mount Kailas and Lake Manasarovar in Tibet were considered to be the best soma regions. High altitudes impart a special prana to plants that allows them to transmit cosmic and astral influences that are more accessible in mountain regions. Any This is well known in most native healing traditions . Soma is a very volatile substance, however. It is found mainly in wild plants, freshly picked. Ayurveda always consid­ ers that the fresh juice of the plant has the strongest healing properties. This is because it contains the most soma. Even plants that contain soma ingredients can lose these if they are not taken fresh or prepared so as to endure. This is an important issue in herbalism today because wild plants are hard to get and it is also hard to preserve their potency In terms of soma, the quality of herbs is as important as their specific nature. Soma plants were prepared by first crushing the juice. This was then mixed or cooked with milk, ghee, yogurt, barley, honey or sugar cane juice and sometimes fermented, as many different types of soma preparations existed. They were sometimes pre­ pared with metals like gold, just as ayurvedic herbs in India are • 188 Yoga and Ayurveda today Such alchemical somas were the basis of later alchemical and tantric medicines. Soma was designed to transform the base metal of our worldly nature to the gold of spirituality This is not just a symbol. The base metal is the physical body; the gold is the purified subtle body. Soma was used to help awaken and energize the subtle body Some soma preparations were used for spiritual purposes, some for healing purposes and some for both. Plants also contain a special form of agni or the vegetable fire that allows them to digest light through photosynthesis. The agni of plants, which are pranic creatures, connects to pranagni, the agni of prana in the human body, warming and rally hot potency contain more agni energy, particula rly spicy nervines like calamus, pippali or shankha pushpi. The combina­ tion of herbs high in agni and hgbs high in soma works well There are as many forms of soma as there are of agni. Each kosha has its own soma or nectar, which is the best type of food for it. Herbs prOvide soma for the body and prana, creat­ ing a special brain secretion that promotes contentment and nourishes the higher brain centers. This secretion is reflected as a certain form of saliva produced during pranayama. The soma essence of plants is better transmitted if herbs are prepared along with ritual, mantra and meditation, which cre­ ate a vehicle for the astral energy of the plant. Mantra is another form of agni that helps catalyze the soma ingredients in plants. Herbs mainly work at the level of pranamaya kosha, the vital energy or pranic body Their effect is at a subtler level than food and at a heavier level than mental and sensory influences. Preparing Soma: Herbs for the Practice of Yoga 189 Herbs therefore link body and mind together via the prana. They stimulate the flow of prana through the channels and nadis. The subtle body itself with its various chakras is like a tree with different branches. Herbs facilitate movement of energy through this plant. They work to catalyze pranic processes both of growth and elimination. They aid prana in its job of keeping All herbs that deal with physical health issues have some potential use in yoga practice. Here we will focus on the most important types, which are those that aid in as ana practice. 1. Herbs to increase flexibility, promote circulation and stimu­ late the movement of energy. Such herbs aid in the proper per­ formance of asanas by improving musculoskeletal function and Typical herbs: guggul, shallaki, myrrh, nirgundi, turmeric, saffron, Siberian ginseng, angelica, kava kava, dasha mula These are usually taken with honey and warm water or with spicy stimulants like ginger and cinnamon to increase their ef­ fects. They do better if supplemented with oil massage, particu­ larly with medicated sesame oil formulas, or with sweating thera­ 2. Herbs to increase physical energy and vitalit y.

In this way pancha Pancha karma radically remove toxins not only from the physical body but also from the subtle body.

Therefore pancha karma is a helpful procedure for anyone on a yogic path, not only for as ana but for pranayama and meditation. Pancha karma can be done as part of a detoxification program, to start a deeper level of practice, or as a regular measure to prevent the toxins from accumulating. 34 • ga postures or asanas are one of the most important systems of physical culture ever invented. They reflect an amazing understanding of how the body works and, particula rly, how to release tension at a deep level from the Asanas keep the body in the best possible health. They pro­ vide specific positions and movements designed to strengthen and stretch the musculature to effectively move the body away from small pains and illnesses back to perfect and normal bal­ ance. They keep the spinal column subtle in order to create the optimal flow of energy through the nerves that enervate the organ and glandular systems. And, perhaps most importan tly, they begin a systematic cleansing of the tissues preparing the Asanas are a part of a sacred science that comprehends all aspects of consciousness . They are not only significant in them­ selves, but are a preparation for pranayama and meditation. They reflect not only a profound knowledge of the body but also of prana, mind and spirit, of which the body is only an external image or manifestation. In the present chapter we will explore Asana is originally part of the deeper practices of yoga, but can also be done as exercise or as a therapy Most people in the West perform asanas as exercise. This has become the meaning of yoga for them, which they associate with yoga postures. While as ana can be a discipline in its own right, asana as exercise or as therapy should not be confused with the role of asana in classical yoga, which goes beyond this. Yoga should not be reduced to asana, which is only a fraction of the greater system. Asana is mainly meant to help reduce rajas or the quality of assertive perfornlance of asanas is counterproductive from a deeper pranayama cannot proceed smoothly Without proper asana to settle the senses, pratyahara or control of the senses is almost impossible .

They may benefit from a period of intense asana practice for a few years as part of physical purification. Then their body will not weigh them down as they seek to go deeper Yoga in the true sense of deep meditation usually occurs tation happens, concern about asana fades away; the physical body and its position are forgotten. Many great yogis, we should note, were not great as ana practitioners. Swami Vivekananda, for example, who first brought yoga to the West around the turn of the last century, was poor at asanas except for a few • sitting postures. Similarly, many people who are good at asana may not be adept at deeper yogic meditational practices. Of the different yoga paths, the yoga of knowledge Gnana view, the cultivation of attention is the main thing. Similarly, It emphasizes divine love and the attitude of the heart. Raja Yoga emphasizes meditation and makes asana important only in a preliminar y sense. Hatha yoga is the main yoga that uses asana as a primary tool. Yet prana is more important in hatha Many great yogis learned their asanas from their own awak­ ened prana, not from physical practice. In fact, prana is the original teacher of yoga postures, not mere human instruction. The true teacher of asana does so through awakening the prana of the student, not simply by teaching how to put the body into different poses. We should learn to use the power of prana to direct our asana practice from within, making it a creative process. When prana directs asana, its healing power is much greater. When prana is the focus of the asana practice and the pearls are placed on a string, then you have the practice of yoga Ayurveda recommends asanas as its most important lifestyle recommendation for exercise. It also prescribes asanas as an important treatment measure for various diseases. Half of ayurvedic treatment is what goes into the body, which is mainly food. The other half is what the body does by way of expres­ sion, which is mainly exercise. Asana deals with this. Asana On the level of prana, herbs are the food and pranayama is the exercise. For these to work properly, the foundation of right posture and right diet in the physical body are necessary. A great variety of asanas is necessary to deal with the exercise and therapeutic requirements of different individual constitutions and Asanas help treat all diseases but are rarely a complete treat­ ment in themselve s. Their action is mainly indirect, except in the case of musculoskeletal or structural problems. Asanas work lease toxins and improve the healing and growth of tissues. This catalyzes the body's healing processes on several levels. Asana is the main yogic tool for balancing the physical body. It consists of various static postures and physical movements performed to release tension, improve flexibility, maximize the flow of energy, and remove friction. The purpose of asana is to create a free flow of energy in order to help direct our attention within. But this flow of energy can also focused on the body to Our physical posture affects our health, vitality and aware­ channels from those which carry food to those which carry thoughts.

It inhibits the circulation of energy and nutrients while allowing toxins and waste materials to accumul ate. Such blockages cause • Asana: Yoga Postures for Health and Awareness 209 discomfort and reduce functioning, resulting in pain and dis­ ease. As mind and body are interconne cted, physical blockages intertwine with mental and emotional blockages and hold vari­ gestive tract. If our posture is wrong then movement through the digestive tract gets obstructed. This disturbs or lowers the functioning of agni, the digestive fire, which in turn weakens or deranges digestion, leading to various ailments . Tightness in the upper back and chest weakens the appe­ tite, which is determined by the prana in the head and mouth. digestive fire in the small intestine , which can become squashed by accumulated tension, causing malabsorption of food. Tight­ ness or weakness in the lower back and abdomen constricts and weakens the colon. This creates gas and distention and upsets elimination, resulting in constipation or diarrhea and the respiratory and Circulatory systems of the physical body. Oxygen, the physical counterpart of prana, is carried through the blood to energize all the tissues. If our posture is wrong then the lungs get impaired in their function. The breath be­ comes shallow and oxygen absorption is reduced. Mucus and stagnant air build up in the lungs, leading to congestion, infec­ ered along with poor immune function.

The nervous system connects specifically to vata dosha, the bio­ logical air humor, which is the chief or guide of the other two Wrong posture therefore aggravates vata primarily and dis­ and dryness in the bones and joints, leading either to stiffness and reduced movement or to tremors and disturbed movements. This tension gets transferred to the nerves, leading to insom­ nia, anxiety and emotional instability. The nervous system is governed by the spine, so all distortions of the spine will cause corresponding nerve tension and problems, mainly of a vata nature. By loosening the joints through yoga postures, the ac­ cumulated vata gets relieved, improving health and awareness on all levels. We can easily observe how fear and stress cause the body to tighten up. Such emotions get held in the bones and prevent our energy from moving freely.

Anyone who does a job that requires only one type of physical activity will have a posture that gets distorted in the direction of their work. Often our most comfortable lounging chairs also distort our posture during hours of resting or watching television. Intellectual people, who are commonly vata in nature, ne­ glect their bodies and'hold them in stiff positions which makes fleXibility decline. This can cause them to become hypersenSi­ tive owing to the accumulated vata in the bones. Traveling also aggravates vata for those who have jobs that require frequent Yet even people who perform asanas on a daily basis may do so in a way that is not optimal. Asanas done forcefully or attempting to place the body in some ideal posture that is not natural to it can result in tension or injury. Asana done without a cultivation of detachm ent, even if helpful on a physical level, can lead to an increased fixation on the body and rigidity of the Too much emphasis on asana also is not good. It can in­ crease body consciousness and enhance the physical ego. If we really want to go into the full system of yoga, the time we spend doing asanas should not substitute for that spent in deeper 212 Yoga and Ayurveda Babies are naturally flexible and can do movements that adults, even those possessing great flexibility, are incapable of. Children are naturally physically active and athletic and like to play and run, exploring all the potentials of bodily movement. Childhood is the stage of life to begin as ana practice to create a age of vata. Our bodily fluids gradually dry out along with declining vitality The joints begin to stiffen, with loss of flex­ ibility leading to arthritis.

It should be an integral part of our lifestyle regimen at any stage of life, even when it ceases to be our main concern in yoga. Asana: Yoga Postures for Health and Awareness 213 Massage is an important tool for clearing toxins from the musculoskeletal system. Oil massage loosens the joints and nour­ therapies, saunas and sweat lodges improve flexibility and re­ move toxins through the skin. After oil massage, asanas are easier to perform. Combined oil massage and steam therapies are a good aid to asana practice. A complete program of ayurvedic detoxification through pancha karma, using these procedures can take our asana practice to new level. However, massage can never substitute for asana. Regular asanas are essential to long term health. They are like giving oneself a massage and can be done more regularly and for longer periods of time. Asana is useful for all constitutions, though in different ways, and done right works to balance all the doshas. Everyone should practice at least half an hour a day of asana to prevent doshic excesses from developing. Asana is most needed by vata types, who are most prone to postural distortions . Kapha types, who tend to be sedentary and move slowly, benefit from more active to cool down their fiery and focused temperaments . There are two main factors to consider in the practice of asana. The first is the manner and attitude with which the asanas are performed. The second is the particular asanas chosen. The first factor is the most Significant. It is more important how we perform an asana than which particular asanas we do. The right 214 Yoga and Ayurveda as ana done in the wrong way will not be helpful. On the other hand, an as ana that may not be the best for a person's constitu­ tion, if done in the right manner and as part of a complete We may get the impression from ayurvedic books that the nature of the particular asana is the main thing, rather than how it is done. They list various asanas for different constitutions or diseases, as if one merely did the appropriate asana for the con­ dition to be corrected. While specific asanas do relate to par­ ticular constitutions, they must be done correctly for their ben­ Sometimes ayurvedic books recommend asanas that can be very difficult to do except for an advanced practitioner. The level of the student must not be forgotten in such instances. A beginner can get into a trouble trying to perform a difficult posture that is supposed to be good for their constitution but that they are not flexible enough to do properly Our bodies need to be prepared for the new movements and different muscle loads we apply when doing asanas unfamiliar to us. For in­ stance, the headstand, which has very valuable benefits, can be dangerous if done incorrectly or if the body is not properly prepared. Trying to force oneself into asanas is unwise. Asana is not merely a simple matter of constitutio n. For example, the headstand is generally good for kapha, but a kapha person who is overweight and has a weak neck may be harmed by it. The particularities of individual bodily structure and organic condition cannot be forgotten. It is better to prescribe asanas according to the individual' s condition and modify them according to ayurvedic considerations rather than to prescribe as ana based upon ayurvedic constitution as the d�ciding factor. In addition, individuals of one doshic constitution can suf­ fer from diseases owing to another dosha. A vata person may have a kapha condition like a common cold, for example. Or a Asana: Yoga Postures for Health and Awareness 215 pitta person may come down with a vata condition, like in­ somnia, from too much traveling and overwork. In these in­ stances, treatment aims at the dosha out of balance rather than It is more important how we move into and maintain an asana than any technical perfection of form that we may be able to hold while in it. The main thing is to use the as ana as a vehicle for directing the prana to the part of the body that one is seeking to benefit. Prana has the healing affect, not the as ana by itself! For the prana to come into the posture requires link­ ing the breath with the posture, which generally requires mov­ Moving into and adjusting an asana position while main­ taining a strong focus on the breath creates a much deeper prac­ tice than simply focusing on body technique. This requires moving with prana, which means having one's attention focused on the free flow of energy, not on holding the body forcefully in a particular pose. Static asanas should arise through relax­ ation of effort, not through artificially holding a pose 35 The same asanas can be adjusted for different doshic types. Asanas done slowly, steadily and gently will generally reduce ation will reduce pitta. Those done with quickness, heat and effort will reduce kapha. We can apply different forms of pranayama relative to asanas to either make them more heating or cooling, more building or reducing, further modifying their impact on the doshas. The application of asanas relative to dif­ ferent doshic types, therefore, requires adaptation and cannot Asanas are seldom done Singly but as part of a sequence. During a sequence of asanas one can do various asanas for their benefits of exercising different muscles and joints, even if not all the asanas performed may be ideal for the constitutional 216 Yoga and Ayurveda type. The sequence as a whole should reduce the dosha. For example, pittas can do some heating asanas, even a headstand, but should do a practice dominated by and ending with cool­ ing asanas. A complete practice will cover the full range of bodily motions and all main types of asanas, though each doshic type will require emphasizing some asanas more than others and doing them all in a manner that reduces their dosha . Vata types are generally slight in built, with small bones and thin frames. They have a great deal of flexibility and agility when young but lack energy and stamina . They easily develop stiffness and rigidity as they age. Vata rules over the bones so vata types suffer most from arthritis, particularly after the age of fifty They tend to be cold, with dry skin and cracking joints, along with poor circulation. Vata types are nervous and fearful. They commonly adapt a protective posture with raised shoul­ ders and hunched back. They are also prone to scoliosis. Asana is a must for vata types. Without it they are unlikely to be If we look at different asana practitioners, we will find that both the best and the worst will be mainly vata types. Vatas tant for vatas to remember to keep their spines flexible. Vata types who neglect their bodies and get too focused in their minds are likely to be the worst at as ana practice. Vatas, being somewhat brittle and prone to excessive movement, are also most likely to be injured by wrong practice and ' too strong asanas. Vatas must approach as ana carefully as they can easily hurt themselve s. Asana: Yoga Postures for Health and Awareness 217 Vatas need to perform asanas in a way that reduces vata, starting with the right mental attitude. They should never rush or hurry into asana practice. They should first put their minds in a calm space and place their emotions in a condition of rest. They should slow down and deepen their breath before begin­ ning any postures. Vatas should warm up their bodies gradu­ ally, improving their circulation and loosening their joints. They should be aware of overexertion or of attempting postures be­ fore their bodies are ready They should exercise to the point of a mild sweat only and make sure to have good fluid intake during the exercise period. A gentle attitude and gradually flowing Asana practice for vata types should emphasize the pelvic region and colon, the main sites of vata. They should aim at releasing tension from the hips, lumbar spine and sacroiliac joints. In general their asanas should restrict movement in order to counter vata's tendency to excess activity Too much move­ ment and stretching can cause them to overstretch their liga­ ments and lose strength. However, when vata leads to rigidity, then asana practice should work to increase movement and pranic flow into the stiffened areas, but in a gradual and steady manner. Sitting postures are good for vata, particular ly those that create strength and stillness in the lower abdomen like siddhasana Since vata tends to accumulate in the spine, making it stiff, vatas should focus on keeping the spinal column supple by practicing spinal bending in every direction. Spinal twists like matsyedrasana are excellent, removing vata from the nervous when the breath is reduced even a little by the partial shutting down of one lung that can happen during twists, vata increases Forward bends afford immediate relief for excess vata, pro­ ducing calm and stillness. They are excellent for releasing vata in the back where it builds up as stiffness and tension. They remove excess vata out of the body through the joints. But they cannot remove all vata unless combined with backbends . Backbends are excellent for reducing vata but must be done gently and slowly to be effective. Vata commonly causes ky­ phosis and curvature of the shoulders. This stiffness, if attacked too aggressivel y, can cause pain or injury. Strong backbends are sympathetic stimulation flight or fight action in the body's well grounded and done moderate ly, strengthen the vata's feel­ ings of centeredness and have a warming effect, strengthening apana and the colon. Small backward bends, like cobra and locust, are the safest in this regard. More complete backbends Standing postures that emphasize strength, stability and calm are very good for vata, particularly those that aim at developing need to develop patience and concentration in order to appreci­ Vata people require gentle yoga procedures that do not ex­ haust them. They should only exert themselves moderately. They should follow any movement asanas with longer periods of sitting postures. To control vata they should practice pranayama After asana practice, vatas should make sure to rest and re­ lax through the practice of the corpse pose. They should not end their practice abruptly or hurry off into any disturbing ac­ tivity. Vatas should come away from asana practice feeling stable, warmed and calm, with tension released from the lower abdo­ men. Their minds should feel peaceful and emotions steady and grounded, with both space and energy for meditation. Asana: Yoga Postures for Health and Awareness 219 Pitta types have medium or average builds. They are nei­ ther too tall nor too short in height, neither too heavy nor too thin in weight. They usually possess a good musculature and flexibility owing to their good circulation and the oily quality of pitta that lubricates the joints. When they dedicate them­ selves to asana practice, pittas become quite good at it. Still postures. They can also make their joints too loose from exces­ sive practice, which can create problems just as significant as Psycholo gically, pittas are aggressive and like to excel and shine at what they do. They may take their high achievement mentality into asana practice where it is not appropriate. This can make them good at the technical side of as ana but in the process they can lose the spiritual effect of practice, which de­ pends upon peace of mind. Pitta people are often overly ambi­ tious, irritable or driven. Yoga postures should be used to cool them down both on the physical and emotional levels. This helps them direct their intelligence within, where they can use Pittas should perform asanas in a way that is cooling, nur­ turing, expansive and relaxing. This requires relaxing breaths and quiet sitting between strong asanas to release any stress that is developing. They should be careful not to turn their practice into a strong workout in which additional heat is gen­ erated in the body or in which too much sweating occurs. They should avoid overheating the blood or bringing too much heat to the head. This does not mean that they cannot do any strong practice but that they should make sure to compensate for any heat created by ending with cooling postures and cooling According to the yogic understanding of the body, the solar principle is centered around the navel, the place of the digestive fire that brings heat to the body. The lunar principle is located in the region of the soft palate, where salivary secretions con­ stantly take place that have a cooling and moistening effect. The upward moving heat of the sun in the navel works to reduce the activity of the moon in the soft palate. Putting the body regularly into the shoulder stand or plow pose protects the lunar principle from the depleting heat of the solar principle and creates coolness. Such postures help reverse the positions of the sun and the moon in the body, bringing balance. This is naturally beneficial for pittas. Spinal twists, like Matyendrasana, are also very good for protecting the lunar principle without Pitta people are benefited by postures that aim at releaSing where pitta accumulates. Such are the bow pose, cobra pose, boat pose, and fish pose. These postures allow excess pitta to be eliminated from the body, particularly to flow downward through the digestive tract. Headstands create pitta and should not be done unless one knows how to balance out the heat Forward bends are generally good for pitta because they grounding effect if done in a gentle manner. Backbends tend to be heating and so should be done only with moderation and followed by cooling postures. Seated twists help clear the liver, detoxifying pitta. Pittas should come away from asana practice feeling cool, content and calm, with tension released from the emotions at rest, with no feelings of competitiveness or irrita­ tion. Their awareness should be in a meditative mood, slightly diffused and not overly sharp. Asana: Yoga Postures for Health and Awareness 221 Kapha types possess stocky builds and hold weight easily They are generally shorter than average in height but some­ times are tall. Their frame, however, is always bulky with short bones and generally poor flexibility For this reason kaphas should not try to force themselves into positions like the lotus pose, which are not appropriate for the type of joints that they have, or they can get hurt. Kapha people should not imagine themselves as tall skinny yogis. That is not their body type and it is not possible for them to maintain that build, even if they weight when they get older, particularly after childbirth. This often disturbs them and causes them to pursue weight loss pro­ grams, including through yoga postures, at which they are sel­ dom successful. They must learn to accept their builds and not try to force their bodies into a shape that is unnatural to them. However, kaphas must strive to avoid overweig ht, which is to hold a moderate body weight, not to try to starve themselve s. Overweight in kapha types results in accumulation of fat, particularly in the stomach and thighs. This shifts the center of gravity downwar d, causing stooped shoulders and other pos­ tural problems . Kapha also creates mucus in the region of the chest which then moves to different sites in the body, particu­ larly downward. It inhibits movement through the channels by its heavy and damp quality It increases fat along the joints and the surface of the body It builds up in the joints as an exces­ sive synovial fluid. Such excess kapha causes swollen glands, benign cysts, and bone spurs. Many kaphas develop arthritis as a complication of such overweight or poor circulation. Kapha types tend to be sedentary and seldom are physically active unless stimulated or prodded to do so , particularly after childhood. More active exercise is required for them, stimulat­ ing their metabolism and increasing circulation. However, kaphas should increase their exercise in a slow and incremental man­ ner, particular ly if they are severely overweig ht. As kaphas are prone to heart disease and high cholesterol, care must be taken not to overstrain their hearts in any exercise program. Kapha is like a frozen river. Its movement is inhibited by cold. As heat is applied through exercise and deep breathing, the ice begins to melt. It then breaks off in chunks and flows down­ stream. Such kapha, as it moves out of areas of stagnation, can cause problems elsewhere if it is pushed out too forcefully. Kaphas benefit by exercise that causes them to sweat, even profusely, and pushes them beyond what they think is the limit do stronger exercise than they like and must be taught to chal­ Sitting asanas, like any condition of reduced movement, causes kapha to increase. Kaphas easily feel tired or fall into daydreaming when holding seated postures. To benefit by sit­ ting postures, which is necessary for meditation, kaphas must Vinyasas, like the sun salutation with its constant activity, are stimulating to the kapha constitution. Standing postures in general are good for them, particularly as combined with move­ ment and stretching. Virabhadrasana and its variations are good, particular ly aimed at opening the chest, the place in the body where kapha accumulates. Backward bends are generally good for kaphas because they open the chest and increase circulation to the head, where mucus easily builds up for them, blocking the senses and dulling the mind. Forward bends, which tend to contract the chest, are not as good for them except when they are caught up in emotional distress and seek some short Asana: Yoga Postures for Health and Awareness 223 Kapha people usually have slow digestion and low metabo­ lism. To stimulate the digestive capacity, procedures having an yoga postures for them because of this. To counter kapha con­ gestion or stagnation, the right yoga postures combined with pranayama are excellent . This brings more circulation to both body and mind so that they can change their lives in a positive direction. The plow pose is one of the best for opening the Kaphas should come away from as ana practice feeling in­ vigorated, warm and light, with their circulation energized, their chest and lungs open. Their mind and senses should be sharp and clear, with emotional heaviness released and forgotten.

However, because we are not in control of our prana, we can only produce pranic enjoyments according to external factors that remain limited and Yoga teaches us how to master prana and unfold its deeper powers. The yogi learns to ride the waves of prana so that he can experience the bliss of prana in his own consciousness. He master prana we no longer require external forms of enjoy­ ment. We gain power over the mind and senses. This same pranic force can be used to heal body and mind. A true ayurvedic doctor is a pranic healer who knows how to direct prana at will for the benefit of the patient, as well as how to use food, herbs and other healing substances as vehicles for prana. According to the Vedas, the prana within the human body corresponds to the sun in the external world.36 Just as the sun revolves around the sky, so prana revolves through the channel systems of the body and mind. Just as the sun measures time externally, so prana controls it internally. Therefore, the key to the movement of our lives and to taking us beyond the limit of time lies in our ability to control our prana. Just as learning to harness solar energy can transform the external world, so the Pranayama is one of the most central yoga practices, mark­ ing the fourth of the eight limbs of classical yoga. It is the prop on which the entire system of yoga rests. Prana purifies and energizes body and mind for higher meditational practices, with­ out which we lack the energy to pursue them properly. We have already discussed the subject of prana and its five sub­ types, and the three vital essences of prana, tejas and ojas. In this chapter we will examine specific pranayama practices, in­ Please note: Pranayama, particularly stronger types, should be learned from a teacher. The information presented here is Prana means the vital force and ayama means expansion. Therefore pranayama means \"expansion of the vital force.\" How­ ever, some people define pranayama as \"retention of the breath.\" While retention of the breath, if done correctly, is probably the most powerful method to expand the vital force, it is not the only one. If done incorrectly, it can constrict the vital force and aggravate many diseases, just as failing to breathe causes us to faint. Through planayama one slows down and extends the This aids in slowing down and calming the mind, facilitating Pranayama is an integral part of ayurvedic treatment meth­ ods and lifestyle regimens. It is most effective in treating dis­ eases of the respirato ry, circulatory and nervous systems, whose function depends upon the right flow of prana, yet it is excel­ lent for all conditions of debility, low energy, chronic fatigue, weak immunity, and convalescence. It is probably the most important single action that we can do to improve our health. Pranayama not only exercises the lungs but all the organs in the body through the internal massage action of inhalation and exhalation. This massaging action improves circulation to the organs and dispels toxins, bringing the doshas to the di­ gestive tract for elimination. It sets up a deep and powerful organic rhythm to sustain not only health and strength but calm­ Pranayama is an important tool for treating psychological and emotional disorders. It is excellent to counter depression, release grief and attachment, and reduce stress and tension. It is much more effective in raising our spirits than any stimulant or drug. Pranayama enhances the power of tonic herbal therapies to improve vitality, like ginseng, ashwagandha or shatavari. There are many ways to work on prana. Proper nutrition increases prana on a phYSical level. This also requires proper elimination. According to Ayurveda, the prana from food is absorbed in the large intestine , particularly in the upper two­ thirds, which is not simply an organ of elimination. Apana vayu, which resides in this organ, is the most important prana for physical health, insuring that no toxins can build up in the 244 Yoga and Ayurveda body. Laxative herbs, particularly the compound triphala, aid in the right absorption of prana from the food, helping to ground prana in the physical body and cut off the root of physical sues; the immortals are the senses that imbibe nourishment directly through the sense openings in the head. While right food sustains apana, right impressions are required to feed prana. For this contact with nature, rituals and visualizations are im­ portant, as well as sensory therapies involving colors, sounds or aromas. As we grow spiritually we must learn to take in more prana to feed the gods or spiritual powers within us. We need to control apana, particular ly the sexual urge, so that we Mantras, particularly Single syllable or bija mantras like OM the entire mental field, including the subconscio us. Meditation itself, creating space in the mind, generates prana in the mind. When the mind is brought into a silent and receptive state, like the expanse of the sky, a new prana comes into being within it that heals and integrates our awareness . Wherever space and stillness is created, prana or energy must follow. However, the main method for working on prana and pranamaya kosha is Apana, which is aligned with the force of gravity, moves downward resulting in disease, aging, death and the diminu­ tion of consciousness. Prana, which is aligned with the air and space elements, disperses upward through the mind and senses. Uniting these two prime pranas results in strengthening our energy along with awakening our higher faculties. Yogic prac­ tices work to raise apana up to unite with prana and draw prana down to unite with apana, which occurs in the region of the Pranayama develops pranagni or the agni of prana, which is responsible for the digestion of prana in the body Pranagni develops primarily through correct retention of the breath that follows deep inhalation. Inhaled oxygen is food for pranagni; exhaled carbon dioxide is its waste mater ial. Just as fasting pu­ rifies the physical body, so breath retention purifies the subtle body Pranagni creates a special form of sweating that elimi­ The navel, in which all the pranas unite, is also the center of pranagni in the physical body, the agni of prana, which gets enkindled through the union of prana and apana. The navel is the highest of the three lower chakras that are all interconnected. Pranagni gives rise to the kundalini force that awakens these chakras and rises upward, carrying both prana and apana with To practice pranayama rightly we must first build ojas, the vital essence of kapha. Ojas serves as the fluid that holds prana, without which the prana will disperse. It is the wire through which the pranic current can flow. To practice pranayama with­ out developing ojas can cause vata disorders, anxiety, insomnia and ungroundedness . Without the proper ojas to support it, Conversely, prana energizes and purifies ojas. The additional prana taken in through pranayama dries and evaporates ojas in I 246 Yoga and Ayurveda order to bring it to the higher head centers. If we are accumu­ lating ojas, particular ly through sexual abstinence , we should practice pranayama to convert it. Otherwise it will accumulate , become heavy, and by a gravitational force disperse its energy Prana also energizes tejas, like wind does a fire. This gives us fiery vital energy, courage and fearlessness. If we do not develop the prana then the energy of tejas also cannot endure. Pranayama aids in developing tejas, which is the expression of pranagni, the fire of prana. Note the chapter on prana, tejas and ojas. While pranayama is usually defined as balancing prana and apana, eventually all five pranas must be considered. Vyana and samana both relate to retention. Samana is the initial stage of retention in which the air is consolidated in the lungs, with oxygen absorbed through the lung tissue. Vyana is the second stage of retention in which the absorbed oxygen is taken into Udana and apana both relate to exhalation. Udana is the first stage of exhalation that creates positive energy and effort, which allows for speech. Apana is the second stage of exhala­ tion that pushes out the waste air and carbon dioxide. Through pranayama we can balance and regulate all five pranas.",

Tonifying therapies increase body strength and weight and counter debilitating and wasting diseases. RedUcing therapies 248 Yoga and Ayurveda reduce body weight and eliminate toxins, countering fevers and Retention after deep inhalation increases the brimhana or tonifying effect of pranayama. It is useful for calming vata and building ojas. It has a stabilizing and grounding effect, giving Retention after exhalation increases the langhana or reduc­ ing aspect of pranayama. This is good for reducing kapha and increasing prana and has a detoxifying effect. It promotes the but it can aggravate vata if we hold the breath too long. To practice pranayama, sit in any comfortable sitting pos­ or sit comfortably in a chair. Face either the north or the east. The room should be well ventilated but without direct expo­ sure to the wind or temperature changes. The best time for Also good are sunrise and sunset and the time immediately The first place to start pranayama practice is with simple natural breathing. Allow your breath to deepen naturally and without effort. Mentally repeat the mantra So upon inhalation am 1.\" Become comfortable in this practice before attempting to manipulate the breath. So'ham pranayama should be performed with the ujjayi breath, breathing with a sound in the back of Most forms of pranayama are done with the ujjayi breath. One breathes deeply, making a noticeable sound with the breath from the back of the throat. Ujjayi breathing has a heating ef­ fect. It reduces kapha and vata and improves agni, stimulating prana in the head, throat and heart. It should not be practiced during alternate nostril breathing, however, which should fo­ Alternate Nostril Breathing: Balancing Prana and Apana Prana and apana relate to the right and left nostrils and their channels, the ida and pingala. They can be balanced by balanc­ This requires blocking the nostrils alternately during prac­ tice. First spread out the palm of your right hand. Turn down your index and middle fingers. Extend the other two fingers and the thumb . Place these on the bridge of the nose with the thumb on the right side and the extended fingers on the left. Use them to block the nostrils as needed. In its first form or solar breathing, inhale through the right or solar nostril and exhale through the left or lunar. Gradually increase the period of retention until sweating occurs. In lunar breathing, inhale through the left nostril and exhale through the right. This should be done to reduce body temperature and create coolness. Alternate nostril breathing is the most important pranayama technique used in Ayurveda. The ida and pingala provide the main energy to the body and its organs on the right and left side. The right side of the trunk contains the main organs re­ sponsible for digestion, the liver, gall bladder, and right kidney, including a secondary solar chakra in the region of the liver. The right side of the body along with the right eye, ear, providing acuity of perception and skill in action. The organs responsible for nourishment, the heart and the stomach, as well as the left kidney, are located on the left side of the trunk, including a secondary lunar chakra in the region of the stomach. The left eye, ear, nostril, hand, and foot trans­ mit a similar cooling energy prOViding emotional sensitivity, Our breath predominates in one nostril at a time, alternat­ ing during different hours of the day. Right nostril breathing, which has a heating effect, occurs when the environment or bodily conditions are cool, or after eating when the body must produce heat to digest the food. When bodily and outside con­ ditions are hot, breathing occurs mainly from the left nostril, which has a cooling effect as when we are resting or sleeping. Therefore patients suffering from diseases of cold like obeSity, edema, muscle stiffness and paralysis should emphasize right On the other hand, patients suffering from diseases of heat, like fevers, wasting diseases, or paralysis along with loss of body weight, should emphasize left nostril breathing. Left nos­ tril breathing is also useful in conditions of hyperactivity of the mind, including insomnia , restlessness, and nervous agitation. Right nostril breathing treats hypoactive conditions of the mind Another method used in ayurvedic treatment is to close off one nostril completely with a piece of cotton. To start off, do this practice only for a few minutes. Increase it slowly over a period of weeks until up to an hour or two. However, alternate nostril breathing is preferable to this if one can make the effort. Alternate nostril breathing has the additional benefit that it is easier to control the breath and to make it longer or shorter. The nostril can be used like a straw to suck in air slowly, some­ thing regular nose or mouth breathing cannot do. ,For gaining Methods of Pranayama 251 control of the breath and purification of the channels there is Alternate nostril breathing focuses the breath in the nostrils themselve s, exercising their muscles and increasing the absorp­ tion of prana in the head.

Doing them keeps all The pranic breath is the breath in the head. It is energized through deep inhalation, drawing energy from above into the higher head and brain centers centered in the third eye. Increasing the Pranic Breath: Take a series of sustained deep inhalations, drawing energy from the sky and space around you and bringing it through the head and senses into the third eye. Hold your energy in the third eye during retention as a ball of light and exhale through the third eye, spreading energy through all the senses. You can also do this practice with alternate nos­ tril breathing, focusing on one side of the head at a time. Visualize the prana coming in not only through the nostrils but also through the eyes, ears and mind, opening and purify­ ing the channels and invigorating the entire brain and mind.

The prana breath is useful for treating all diseases of the mind, senses, head, brain and nervous system. It is particularly good for sinus allergies, head colds, and headaches. It aids in nervous exhaustion and brain fatigue. It provides a pranic bath to the brain, refreshing and revitalizing it for more produ ctive The udana breath is the breath in the mouth. It is allied with thought, sound or mantra and the upward movement of Increasing the Udana Breath: Take a deep breath with the mouth and draw the energy into the throat chakra, holding it there upon retention. Upon exhalation loudly chant OM. Feel your energy rise and expand like a ball of light from the OM sound in the mouth to encompass the entire horizon and entire universe. Experience the throat as the center of cosmic sound, speech and vibration. Visualize udana like a deep blue lotus or The udana breath treats all diseases of the throat region and vocal cords. It guards against sore throat, improves the voice, gives vitality and grants more strength. It helps anyone who The vyana breath is the breath in the heart that pervades the entire body and extends outward. Vyana breathing aims at open­ ing the lung and heart region and from there expanding out to the rest of the body, the external world and the whole of life. Increasing the Vyana Breath: Take a deep breath, preferably while standing, extending your arms as widely as possible and Methods of Pranayama 253 filling the heart and lungs with energy. Keep the arms wide apart during retention, visualizing your energy expanding from the heart through the blood stream to the entire body and limbs and out through the hands and feet into the external environ­ ment, extending all the way to the horizon.

Increase the Samana Breath: Visualize the energy from the entire universe and its many galaxies, stars and planets spiral­ ing into your body from the distant horizon.

On exhalation, let ment to all the tissues of your body and all the layers of the energy turning inward into the navel and growing ever more small, concentrated and luminous, providing more stability and The samana breath treats all diseases of the digestive sys­ tem, liver, gall bladder, stomach, and small intestine .

Hold the energy there on re­ tention. Upon exhalation , ground the energy downward through your feet into the earth, allowing any physical or mental toxins to be released into the ground. View apana as a downward­ facing dark blue triangle in the region of the lower abdomen, from which the energy moves downward in lightning flashes and grounds itself into the center of the earth below, where there dwells a speCial fire of strength and resistance. The apana breath treats all diseases of the reproduc tive, uri­ nary and excretory systems. It is good for constipation, diarrhea, menstrual problems and sexual debility It strengthens the im­ mune system, supports ojas, and aids in the prevention of disease. Do the exercises for the five pranas in order, about ten breaths for each prana. Then repeat the entire cycle from the apana breath We can direct the breath through any of the fourteen nadis, not just the sushumna , ida or pingala. For purifying the senses we can direct the breath through any of the sensory nadis. We can practice the prana breath focusing on any of the nadis in ever, it should be done with a receptive mind open to the cos­ One can direct the energy specifically by using the right nostril breath for right nadis and the left nostril breath for left nadis. For example, inhale through the right nostril, visualizing energy coming in through the right eye and its pusha nadi. Exhale through the left nostril, visualizing energy going out through the left eye and its gandhari nadi. This purifies the Similarly, inhale through the right nostril, visualizing en­ ergy come in through the right ear and its payasvini nadi. Ex­ hale through the left nostril, visualizing energy going out through the left ear and its shankhini nadi. This purifies the ears and is One can practice the vyana breath in the same way. Breathe deeply through the right nostril and fill the heart and lungs with the energy drawn in from the right hand and right leg and yashasvati nadi. Exhale through the left nostril and out through the left arm and leg to the palm of the left hand and sole of the For the central nadis one can breathe through both nos­ trils. For the sarasvati nadi, the udana breath can be done by bringing the energy down from the tip of the tongue to the throat chakra on inhalation and from the throat chakra to the tip of the tongue on exhalation. One can Similarly practice the vyana breath through the varuna or heart nadi. Draw the energy from the entire skin region back into the heart upon inhalation vishvodhara nadi supplying all the organs of the digestive sys­ tem. On inhalation, draw the energy from the digestive organs into the navel and back out again during exhala tion. One can practice the apana breath focusing on either kuhu or alambusha 256 Yoga and Ayurveda to purify either the urinogenital or excretory organs. Again draw the energy down the channel during inhalation and out the Sushumna breathing occurs when the prana stays in the sushumna or central channel. While this is very difficult to ac­ complish, we can simulate it in order to gradually set it in motion. Sushumna breathing proceeds mainly through udana, which allows our energy to move upward through the chakras. The udana breath also relates to the breath in the spine, which moves up and down. Spinal breathing helps promote sushumna Increasing the Spinal Breath: Take a series of deep breaths visualizing the prana moving up the spine upon inhalation, having a cooling energy, and down the spine upon exhalation, having a heating energy. Use the mantra SO during inhalation and HAM during exhalation. Draw the breath up by degrees through the different pranic centers from that of apana at the base of the spine to that of prana at the third eye. Increasing the spinal breath is the key to awakening the kundalini. Another method is to draw the prana up the spine through udana during inhalation and extend it out above the head during exhalation. The samadhi breath is very subtle and arises when prana and apana are balanced. Ordinary respiration becomes suspended and an inner force of calm prana sustains both body and mind. In the samadhi breath, inhalation and exhalation become al­ most imperceptible . This occurs mainly through samana vayu functioning in the region of the heart and mind. The samana breath sustains metabolism and homeost asis on all levels, in­ pending body functions while maintaining survival. It has a Method of Samadhi Breath: After a period of prolonged deep breathing, once the breath has become full, rest in the state of calmness of breath in which breathing is no longer necessary. Place your awareness in the heart, in the core or center of your being, and let all your energies return to it as their source. Let the breath flow imperceptibly like gentle waves on the sea. Ex­ perience the peace of mind that goes along with the peaceful breath. However, do not obstruct the natural flow of the breath. Should inhalation or exhalation be necessary, let them occur without strain or interference. The samadhi breath is the culmi­ nation of yoga practice and provides knowledge of the Self and This is also one of the procedures for cleansing the nasal passages in the head. The actual meaning is \"what makes the head shine.\" First do a forceful exhalation a little deeper than ordinary breathing. At the same time, contract the front abdomi­ nal muscles suddenly and with a little force. Then inhale by simply relaXing the abdominal muscles. In this procedure do not do any retention of the breath. The beginner should start with eleven expulsions in each round. Each expiration stimu­ lates the center of the abdomen and activates the prana. Kapalabhati also improves digestion and increases Agni. Sit in a comfortable posture. Close the left nostril as in right nostril breathing. Place your left hand on the left knee. Inhale and exhale through the right nostril without stopping, 258 Yoga and Ayurveda breathing deeply and forcefully at least ten times. Inhale and retain the breath as long as possible, then exhale through the left nostril, keeping the right nostril closed. In the second round, close the right nostril and breathe deeply and forcefully through Bhastrika is a very heating form of pranayama. It clears kapha from the head and chest and increases agni and prana. It counters cough and mucus and helps reduce body weight and fat. It aids in the awakening of kundalini. As it is a forceful practice it should be done with caution, particular ly for weak constitu­ tions, and care should be taken so that it does not aggravate Sit in a comfortable posture. Stick out your tongue and fold up its sides to form a long narrow tube like the beak of a crow. Narrow the passage further by pressing your lips around the tongue. Inhale slowly through the tongue, like sucking water. You will note a distinct cooling sensation. Fill the stomach with air and hold the breath as long as you can comfortably. Then Shitali means \"cooling\" and more effectively counters dis­ eases of heat than left nostril breathing. It counters thirst and builds the plasma. It is even used for high fevers and is an excellent practice for the summer. It is good for high blood pressure and hyperacidi ty. It is mainly for pitta types. Follow the same procedure as shitali. However, while in­ haling produce a sound like \"see.\" Do not hold your breath but exhale immediately through the nostrils. Its benefits are similar Methods of Pranayama 259 to shitali. It clears heat from the head and cools the emotions. A beginner should practice pranayama with an even ratio of inhalatio n, retention and exhalation, letting the breath naturally lengthen. Eventually one can extend the exhalation to twice as long as inhalation. After proficiency is gained, one should practice with a proportion of inhalation one, internal retention two, exhalation two, and external retention two. This requires some The ideal proportion is inhalation one, internal retention four, exhalation two, and external retention four, but only ad­ vanced practitioners can do this and it requires the develop­ ment of much internal strength. In pranayama there should be no straining to achieve results but a natural development by Vata: Practice mainly right nostril breathing in the morning for ten or fifteen minutes to stimulate energy. In the evening, do left nostril breathing to calm the mind and promote sleep. Bhastrika can be helpful when cold but should not be done excessively. Practice should be stopped if one feels dizzy or spaced out. Vatas should do the five prana breaths, focusing on Pitta: Emphasize cooling pranayama. Do lunar or left nostril breathing, particularly in the evening or when feeling hot or irritable. Do shitali inhalation and sitkari exhalation if stronger cooling action is needed, particularly for heat in the head or overheated emotions. Pittas should do the breaths for the five pranas, particula rly the vyana breath for expanding energy and • 260 Yoga and Ayurveda Kapha: Solar or right nostril breathing, which reduces excess kapha in the body, is best for kaphas, particularly in the morn­ ing, when kapha needs to be reduced. Bhastrika and kapalabhati are excellent, particularly when 'suffering from colds, conges­ tion, lethargy or depression. Kapha types should do the five prana breaths, particularly the prana breath to clear kapha from the head and the vyana breath to clear it from the lungs. All paths of yoga are based upon prana. Bhakti yoga or the yoga of devotion brings about pranic transformation by unit­ ing us with the divine prana of love. Karma yoga or service is based upon alignment with the divine Will that gives us more prana, not only for outer actions but for inner development. Classical yoga or Raja Yoga is based upon the control of fore, pranayama helps control the mind. Hatha yoga itself is mainly concerned with prana and asana occurs as an expres­ sion of prana. Even jnana yoga or the yoga of knowledg e de­ pends upon a strong will and concentration. Without a well­ developed udana vayu, it cannot succeed. In the yoga of knowledge , the prana of inquiry must be created, which is to inquire into our true nature not merely mentally but in all of our daily activities . This requires that inquiry occurs through The Vedas say that we are all under the control of prana. Prana is the sun that imparts life and light to all and dwells within the heart as the Self of all creatures. We must open up to and welcome this greater force of prana, bringing it into our life and action. It is the energy through which all yoga proceeds. • is a vast system of spiritual practices for inner growth. To this end, the classical yoga system incorporates eight limbs, each with its own place and· function. Of these, pratyahara is probably the least known. How many people, even yoga teachers, can define pratyahara? Have you ever taken a class in pratyahara7 Have you ever seen a book on pratyahara? Can you think of several important pratyahara techniques? Do you perform pratyahara as part of your yogic practices? Yet un­ less we understand pratyahara , we are missing an integral as­ As the fifth of the eight limbs, pratyahara occupies a central place. Some yogis include it among the outer aspects of yoga, others with the inner aspects. Both classifications are correct, for pratyahara is the key between the outer and inner aspects of yoga; it shows us how to move from one to the other. It is not possible to move directly from as ana to meditation. This requires jumping from the body to the mind, forgetting what lies between. To make this transition, the breath and senses, which link the body and mind, must be brought under control and developed properly This is where pranayama and pratyahara come in. With pranayama we control our vital energies and impulses and with pratyahara we gain mastery over the unruly senses both prerequisites to successful meditation. The term pratyahara is composed of two Sanskrit words, prati and ahara. Ahara means \"food,\" or \"anything we take into ourselves from the outside.\" Prati is a preposition meaning \"against\" or \"away\" Pratyahara means literally \"control of ahara,\" or \"gaining mastery over external influences .\" It is compared to a turtle withdrawing its limbs into its shell the turtle's shell is the mind and the senses are the limbs. The term is usually translated as \"withdrawal from the senses,\" but much more is In yogic thought there are three levels of ahara, or food. The first is physical food that brings in the five elements neces­ sary to nourish the body The second is impressions, which bring in the subtle substances necessary to nourish the mind third level of ahara is our associations, the people we hold at heart level who serve to nourish the soul and affect us with the Pratyahara is twofold. It involves withdrawal from wrong food, wrong impressions and wrong associations, while simul­ taneously opening up to right food, right impressions and right associations. We cannot control our mental impressions with­ out right diet and right relationship , but pratyahara' s primary importance lies in control of sensory impressions which frees By withdrawing our awareness from negative impressions, pratyahara strengthens the mind's powers of immunity Just as Pratyahara: the Forgotten Limb of Yoga 263 a healthy body can resist toxins and pathogens, a healthy mind can ward off the negative sensory influences around it. If you are easily disturbed by the noise and turmoil of the environ­ ment around you, practice pratyahara . Without it, you will not important form of pratyahara, although this is not something Most of us suffer from sensory overload, the result of constant bombardment from television, radio, computers, newspapers, magazine s, books you name it. Our commercial society func­ tions by stimulating our interest through the senses. We are constantly confronted with bright colors, loud noises and dra­ matic sensations. We have been raised on every sort of sensory indulgence; it is the main form of entertainment in our society. The problem is that the senses, like untrained children, have their own will, which is largely instinctual in nature. They tell the mind what to do. If we don't diSCipline them, they domi­ nate us with their endless demands. We are so accustomed to ongoing sensory activity that we don't know how to keep our minds quiet; we have become hostages of the world of the senses and its allurements. We run after what is appealing to the senses and forget the higher goals of life. For this reason, pratyahara is probably the most important limb of yoga for people today. The old saying \"the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak\" 264 Yoga and Ayurveda applies to those of us who have not learned how to properly strengthen the spirit and reduce its dependency on the body. Pratyahara centers on the right intake of impressions. Most of us are careful about the food we eat and the company we keep, but we may not exercise the same discrimination about the impressions we take in from the senses. We accept impres­ sions via the mass media that we would never allow in our personal lives. We let people into our houses through televi­ sion and movies that we would never allow into our homes in real life! What kind of impressions do we take in every day? Can we expect that they will not have an effect on us? Strong sensations dull the mind, and a dull mind makes us act in ways that are insensitive , careless, or even violent. According to Ayurveda, sensory impressions are the main food for the mind. The background of our mental field con­ sists of our predominant sensory impressions. We see this when our mind reverts to the impressions of the last song we heard or the last movie we saw. Just as junk food makes the body toxic, junk impressions make the mind toxic. Junk food re­ quires a lot of salt, sugar, or spices to make it palatable because it is largely dead food; Similarly junk impressions require pow­ erful dramatic impressions sex and violence to make us feel that they are real, because they are actually just colors pro­ We cannot ignore the role sensory impressions play in making us who we are, for they build up the subconscious and strengthen the tendencies latent within it. Trying to medi­ tate without controlling our impressions pits our subconscious Pratyahara: the Forgotten Limb of Yoga 265 against us and prevents the development of inner peace and Fortunately we are not helpless before the barrage of sen­ sory impressio ns. Pratyahara provides us many tools for man­ aging them properly. Perhaps the Simplest way to control our impressions is simply to cut them off, to spend some time apart from all sensory inputs. Just as the body benef its by fast­ ing from food, so the mind benefits by fasting from impres­ sions. This can be as simple as sitting to meditate with our eyes closed or taking a retreat somewhere free from the normal sensory bombardments, like at a mountain cabin. Also a \"me­ dia fast,\" abstaining from television, radio, etc. can be a good Yoni mudra is one of the most important pratyahara tech­ niques for closing the senses. It involves using the fingers to block the sensory op enings in the head the eyes, ears, nos­ trils, and mouth and allowing the attention and energy to move within. It is done for short periods of time when our prana is energized, such as immediately after practicing pranayama . Another method of sense withdrawal is to keep our sense organs open but withdraw our attention from them. In this way we cease taking in impressions without actually closing off our sense organs. The most common method, shambhavi mudra, consists of sitting with the eyes open while directing the attention within, a technique used in several Buddhist sys­ tems of meditation as well. This redirection of the senses in­ ward can be done with the other senses as well, particularly with the sense of hearing. It helps us control our mind even when the senses are functioning, as they are during the normal 266 Yoga and Ayurveda Another way to cleanse the mind and control the senses is to put our attention on a source of uniform impressions, such as gazing at the ocean or the blue sky. Just as the digestive trary food qualities, our ability to digest impressions can be deranged by jarring or excessive impressions . And just as im­ mental digestion may require a diet of natural but homoge­ neous impressions . This technique is often helpful after a pe­ Another means of controlling the senses is to create posi­ tive, natural impressions. There are a number of ways to do this: meditating upon aspects of nature such as trees, flowers, or rocks, as well as visiting temples or other places of pilgrim­ age which are repositories of positive impressions and thoughts. Positive impressions can also be created by using incense, flow­ ers, ghee lamps, altars, statues, and other artifacts of devotional Another sensory withdrawal technique is to focus the mind on inner impressions, thus removing attention from external impressions. We can create our own inner impressions through the imagination or we can contact the subtle senses that come sions. In fact, most yogic meditation practices begin with some type of visualizati on, such as \"seeing\" a deity, a guru, or a beau­ tiful setting in nature. More elaborate visualizations involve imagining deities and their worlds, or mentally performing rituals, such as offering imaginary flowers or gems to imagined deities. The artist absorbed in an inner landscape or the musician creat­ ing music are also performing inner visualizations. These are all forms of pratyahara because they clear the mental field of external impressions and create a positive inner impression to serve as the foundation of meditation. Preliminary visualiza­ tions are helpful for most forms of meditation and can be inte­ Laya Yoga is the yoga of the inner sound and light current, in which we focus on subtle senses to withdraw us from the gross senses. This withdrawal into inner sound and light is a means of transforming the mind and is another form of indriya­",

      "description": "The yogis tell us that mind is the sixth sense organ and Pratyahara: the Forgotten Limb of Yoga 269 that it is responsible for coordinating all the other sense or­ gans. We take in sensory impressions only where we place our mind's attention. In a way we are always practicing pratyahara . The mind's attention is limited and we give attention to one sensory impression by withdrawing the mind from other im­ pressions. Wherever we place our attention, we naturally over­ We control our senses by withdrawing our mind's attention from them. According to the Yoga Sutras II.54: \"When the senses do not conform with their own objects but imitate the nature of the mind, that is pratyahara .\" More specifically, it is mano­ pratyahara withdrawing the senses from their objects and directing them inward to the nature of the mind, which is form­ less. Vyasa's commentary on the Yoga Sutra notes that the mind is like the queen bee and the senses are the worker bees. Wher­ ever the queen bee goes, all the other bees must follow. Thus controlling the mind, for when the mind is controlle d, the senses ing our attention from unwholesome impressions whenever they arise. This is the highest form of pratyahara and the most diffi­ cult; if we have not gained proficiency in controlling the senses, motor organs, and pranas, it is unlikely to work. Like wild animals, prana and the senses can easily overcome a weak mind, . so it is usually better to start first with more practical methods Pratyahara is related to all the limbs of yoga. All of the other limbs from asana to samadhi contain aspects of pratyahara . For example, in the sitting poses, which are the 270 Yoga and Ayurvecla most important aspect of asana, both the sensory and motor organs are controlled. Pranayama contains an element of pratyahara as we draw our attention inward through the breath. Yama and niyama contain various principles and practices, like In other words, pratyahara provides the foundation for the higher practices of yoga and is the basis for meditation. It follows Pratyahara is also linked with dharana. In pratyahara we withdraw our attention from ordinary distractions. In dharana we conscious ly focus that attention on a particular object, such as a mantra. Pratyahara is the negative and dharana the positive Many of us find that even after years of meditation practice we have not achieved all that we expected. Trying to practice meditation without some degree of pratyahara is like trying to gather water in a leaky vessel. No matter how much water we bring in, it flows out at the same rate. The senses are like holes in the vessel of the mind. Unless they are sealed, the mind cannot hold the nectar of truth. Anyone whose periods of medi­ tation alternate with periods of sensory indulgence is in need Pratyahara offers many methods of preparing the mind for meditation. It also helps us avoid environmental disturbances that are the source of psychological pain. Pratyahara is a mar­ velous tool for taking control of our lives and opening up to our inner being. It is no wonder some great yogis have called it \"the most important limb of yoga.\" We should all remember to include it in our practice. Pratyahara: the Forgotten Limb of Yoga 271 Pratyahara, as right management of the mind and senses, is essential and good for all constitutional types. It is the most important factor for mental nutrition. However, it is most es­ sential for those with a vata constitution who tend towards imbalanced or excessive sensory and mental activity. All vata types should practice some form of pratyahara daily. Their rest­ less vata distracts the senses, disturbs the motor organs and prana, and makes the mind restless. Pratyahara reverse harmful Kapha types, on the other hand, generally suffer from too little activity, including on a sensory level. They may slip into tamasic patterns of being lazy, watching television or sitting around the house. They need more mental stimulation and benefit from sensory activity of a higher nature, like visualizations of Pitta types generally have more control of the senses than they diScipline the body and the senses. They need to practice pratyahara as a means of relaxing the personal will and letting Ayurveda recognizes that the inappropriate use of the senses is one of the main causes of disease.38 All mental disease is connected with the intake of unwholesome impressi ons. Pratyahara therefore is an important first step in treating all mental disorders. Similarly it is very helpful in treating nervous system disorders, particularly those that arise through hyperactivity. Most of the time we overly express our emotions, which loses tre­ mendous energy. Pratyahara teaches us to hold our energy within 272 Yoga and Ayurveda and not disperse it unnecessar ily. This conserved energy can be drawn upon for creative, spiritual or healing purposes as needed and can provide the extra power to do the things that are really Physical disease mainly arises from taking in unwholesome food. Pratyahara affords us control of the senses so that we do not crave wrong food. When the senses are controlle d, every­ thing is controlled and no wrong or artificial cravings can arise. That is why Ayurveda emphasizes right use of the senses as one of the most important factors in right living and disease f we carefully examine all the different yogic paths from devotion and knowledge to hatha and raja yogas, we will discover that mantra is the most common yogic practice. We could say that yoga is mantra. While the as an as or postures for the body may be more evident, mantras are equally impor­ tant as postures for the mind. Just as asana gives health and Mantra, energized sound or the sacred word, is the basis of all religious traditions, scriptures and prayers. In one form or another, it is the key religious practice of humanity As we are constantly either talking to others or speaking to ourselves through our thoughts, we should learn to employ the power of sound and the Word to master this main activity of our lives. Mantra is also the main practice that links yoga and Ayurveda. The two basic treatment methods of Ayurveda are herbs for the body and mantras for the mind. Whereas yoga employs mantra is the main tool for working on the mind. Its influence extends to the deepest level of our consciousness. Mantra, repeated mentally, cleanses the causal body or samskaric field of the soul and helps alter subconscious habits and afflictions. On the other hand, mantra, as spoken or chanted, is an important tool for healing the subtle body and clearing our field of impressions. Mantra can be used to direct the healing power of prana, which it carries. Prana has its own sound or mantric power that we can learn to master and direct at will through the right use of speech and sound. I have dealt with prana mantra at some length in my other books, particular ly Ayurveda and the Mind. Here I will add an important teaching on mantra through which we can link together physical and psychological practices. The chapter also contains a key to the Sound is the original form of all energy. Space, which ulti­ mately is consciousness, gives rise to energy which is prana or life. Sound is the mental aspect of prana. All aspects of the mind, from the outer to the inner, have their corresponding sound vibration. The mind is composed of thoughts, which are words and sounds. Each person's mind has its own sound pattern or mantra. The soul itself has its own mantric vibra­ tion; when we learn it, we can awaken all the powers within. Sound always has a referent, an object for which it is the name. Each sound is a name which reflects the idea behind the sound. All names link us to the being or object that they desig­ nate. Sound is a means of directing awareness through the name to a particular object. Along with awareness always goes energy or prana. Hence, through mantra we can direct the energy of consciousness and prana and link it up with whatever we seek. Mantra Purusha: the Person of Sound 275 This is the importance of prayer or speaking to the divine, through which we can receive divine grace. We can even speak to the limbs and organs of the body Mantra can direct a heal­ ing energy to them and awaken the organic intelligence that is The human being is a creation of sound which creates our different bodies, starting with the causal body The causal body, soul or deeper mind is our aspect of the divine Word. The Creator breathes this divine Word into the soul as its immortal life. This Word is the vibration of cosmic consciousness which is the origin of time, space, intelligence and prana. It forms the ideal pattern or dharma behind our soul's existence. The subtle body is also a creation of sound. Sound is the sense quality of the element of ether that generates and sustains the field of impressions that is the subtle body Prana itself is unmanifest sound, which we hear through the natural sound of the breath. Even the physical body is shaped by sound. Speech, the breath, and the pumping of the heart create the rhythm The human body, therefore, is a sound body and we can work on its energies through sound alone. The human body can be represented by the letters of the Sanskrit alphabet, called the Mantra Purusha or \"person of sound.\" In this regard, the sixteen Sanskrit vowels make up the head of the Mantra Purusha; the five sets of five consonants, twenty five in all, make up the and \"h\" sounds make up the tissues, prana and mind. consonant for their pronunciation. Therefore they represent mind and spirit, the formless aspect of reality that works through the head and the senses. Consonants are dependent sounds, re­ quiring a vowel for their pronunciat ion. Therefore they repre­ sent matter and form, which is expressed in the body through 276 Yoga and Ayurveda the trunk and limbs that give us a shape and allow us to func­ \"5\" and \"h\" sounds are also intermediate in nature as they can the outer tissues and the elements of the body. \"5\" and \"h\" sounds a special power to create heat.

The mantra OM The mantras for the tissues and chakras are of particular importance and can be used for energizing the body from within and through the spine and the chakras. The Mantra Purusha is also useful for pratyahara. We can use these sounds to withdraw the prana from the different parts of the body and place it in the mind alone. Using the Mantra Purusha, we can gain power over our limbs, senses, prana and mind, learning to switch energy and attention off and on to the different parts of the body. One should recite the Mantra Purusha daily before medita­ tion, first using it to energize all the parts of the body and then Mantra Purusha: the Person of Sound 279 using it to calm them and place the body in a state of peace and receptivity. This is a complete energization exercise for the mind, Recite the Mantra Purusha sounds, starting with the head, to energize all these parts of the body with prana.

The heart marks madhyama or the pranic stage form of speech. The root chakra marks para or the supreme level of speech, which is beyond words. In this regard the higher power of speech lays hidden below in the root chakra as kundalini shakti.

      "description": "editation is the essential and culminating practice of the greater system of yoga. Of the eight limbs of yoga, medicine promotes meditation as one of its main therapies. Much of Ayurveda's popularity comes from its emphasis on medita­ tion and related techniques of mantra and pranayama. Yet meditation proper is a very subtle state that is hard to reach. It requires that we first harmonize the body, prana and senses. Meditation is not just a matter of closing one's eyes and sitting silently An understanding of meditation rests upon un­ derstanding the mind. To approach the subject of meditation Both mind and body are composed of the five elements. The mind, however, is made up of a mental rather than a physical form of the elements.

      "description": "Mind and prana always go together. Wherever we place our self directs a current of energy. Similarly, whatever motivates our energy'and vitality, like hunger or thirst, engages our atten­ tion. Mind and prana are two sides of the same phenomenon, Though prana is generally grosser than the mind, there is a prana in the mind itself, the mind's own energy and vitality. Similarly there is a mind or consciousness in the workings of aspect of mind in prana and some aspect of prana in mind. Prana is inherently a power of intelligence or mind; mind is inherently a power of action and expression of prana. Prana, like the mind, is also vata in nature and composed of the air and ether elements. But there is a difference. Prana has more of the air element and the mind has more of space or the ether element. Prana is more active, like air, while the mind is more receptive and observant, like space. In this regard we could say that the ether aspect of prana is the mind, while the air The mind as a whole, what is called chitta or antahkarana in yogic literature , is in the sphere of vata, similarly composed of air and ether elements . However, the mind is subtler than vata, just as it is subtler than prana from which vata springs. Vata imparts speed and energy to the mind. Vata types have qUicker minds than other types and greater facility on all levels of mental activity from sensory perception to deep formless ways striving to go everywhere and comprehend everything. Because of vata's connection with the mind in general, vata types are more likely to suffer from mental and psychological distur­ bances. Their minds are immediately and strongly affected by 286 Yoga and Ayurveda whatever they do. In the same way, most mental and nervous system disorders are likely to cause vata aggravation. However, the mind has its pitta and kapha sides as well. As a power of light and illuminati on, the mind relates to pitta. For this reason the mind is sometimes identified with fire. Pitta more specifically is the perceptive power of the mind, while background mental field is more vata in nature. We could say plication. The mind has its special power of sight, the mind's eye or third eye that relates to fire. The pitta or fiery side of the also the power of mental digestion. Pitta types are highly intel­ ligent and discerning. They usually have the best mental focus The kapha side of the mind is its feeling capacity from which arises emotion, love and attachme nt. These are connected to the kapha side of the mind is the most outward and material, just as kapha is the most material of the doshas. Yet there is a higher kapha side to the mind. The inner mind or heart has its feeling side as well, like love, the most important Kapha feeling. The bliss itself at the core of the mind is the highest form of kapha. Meditation is our ability to contact our true Self and con­ intelligence. Conversel y, meditation is the ability to clear out the negative aspects of our consciousness, harmful subconscious habits and impulses that cause pain and suffering. Meditation helps promote our highest impulses and also roots out those formed. Such a definition deals with meditation in the broadest sense, which includes the many helpful techniques of mantra, pranayama and visualization. Yet whatever meditation techniques we employ should be used as aids to return our consciousness to its original peaceful and silent state, at which stage we can set the techniques aside and rest in the harmony of our true Nature. This is called \"abiding in the Self.\" It is the natural state of medi­ tation, which is the real goal of all meditative striving. Meditation is an important tool in Ayurveda for healing the mind, but its benefits extend to the body as well. It reduces the psychological root or complications of the disease process, which always exist to some degr ee. Ayurveda recommends meditation for treating specific diseases, particularly psychological disor­ ders in which meditation may be the primary therapy. Ayurveda also prescribes meditation as part of its lifestyle regimens both types of meditation in ayurvedic and yogic thought. Here we will propose an ayurvedic rationale and application for medita­ tion relative to the doshas, the gunas and functions of the mind. Because of the mind's connection with prana, the role of pranic practices in meditation cannot be ignored. Because of prana's connection to food, the physical body cannot be forgot­ ten either.

      "description": "Meditation is an important therapy for psychological and nervous disorders, from simple insomnia to severe emotional disturbances. It is useful in chronic and debilitating diseases like allergies or arthritis, in which stress or hypersensiti vity of the nervous system are involved. Western research has found meditation to be very helpful in treating heart disease. The heart ply the physical heart but our inner core of feeling and know­ ing beyond the sensory mind. Disturbances in our conscious­ ness are reflected in problems with the heart, including on a physical level. Calming the mind and strengthening the heart Meditation helps us deal with pain and should be taught to all patients suffering from painful diseases, whether chronic or acute. We can take our mind off the pain of disease and place our attention in a mantra or in the witnessing mind. Meditation is most important in severe or terminal diseases where death may be near. It prepares the person for the transition into the next life. In fact, meditation helps all of us detach from the body. Attachment to the body is the main cause of physical, psychological and spiritual pain. Removing this attachment is the ultimate cure for all diseases or the way to transcend them Some spiritual teachers hold that changing one's thoughts can cure all diseases, even terminal illnesses. Ayurveda has two qualifications on this. The first is the movement of time. Cer­ tain diseases born of time and aging can be postponed but not eliminated altogether. That is why we all must eventually die. The second is karma. We function according to certain karmas that keep us in this world for a particular period of time. Once our karma is completed, we must move on and sometimes dis­ ease is the means to do this. We must never forget that physical life is only one level of existence for the soul, a temporary jour­ ney. Therefore , we need not cling to physical existence but should strive to fulfill our purpose here and then continue on. However, all forms of meditation are not good for every­ one, any more than all foods or herbs are. For this reason Ayurveda recommends the proper lifestyle and an integral ap­ proach to meditation that considers both our different faculties and the nature of the individual. Meditation and the Mind 289 Meditation should be grounded in a proper lifestyle, par­ ticularly a sattvic diet, sattvic impressions and sattvic associa­ tions. Without these we may not be capable of real meditation, even if we want to practice it. In such cases the background for meditation should be taught along with the practice of medita­ Generally one begins a meditation session with a formal practice, employing techniques like prayer, mantra, pranayama or visualiza tion. Then formless meditation can proceed, like without using any tools to calm the mind first, we may simply get lost in our own thoughts and end up more confused and Meditation, particularly of a passive nature, opens up the subconscious mind. If we are not ready to handle it, this can cause complications. People who are emotion ally disturbed, particular ly when vata is aggravated, are most vulnerable. For this reason mantra may be better than silent meditation, at least in the beginning. Silent meditation is expansive, but for the mind to truly expand it must first be concentrated. This is why concentration exercises usually precede meditation. Ayurveda tries to affirm the natural meditational inclinations of people. There are many paths, teachings and traditions of meditation that have their value and relevance to different indi­ viduals and cultures. However, sometimes the meditation prac­ tices people follow may not be helping them from an ayurvedic standpoint . Vata people may not benefit from trying to space their minds out further. Pitta people may get disturbed by too focused or critical a meditative approach. Kapha types may have kapha increased by too emotional forms of meditation. In such 290 Yoga and Ayurveda instances Ayurveda may recommend that the nature of one's People in the West are more familiar with prayer than medi­ tation. Prayer is a general term and many types of it exist, but the term usually refers to an active form of meditation in which we project an intention calling on God to help us or our with mantra and meditatio n. Generally mantra is energized prayer, a prayer or wish yogically directed by special sound patterns or vibrations of the cosmic Word. Meditation is a silent or con­ templative form of prayer in which there may not be any move­ Ayurvedic doctors use prayer or the direction of positive energies and intentions to treat diseases. This includes chan­ neling the healing force of the divine or the powers of great teachers, avatars and gurus. Prayer as the giving of good wishes ing to take place. It can be used along with the subtle healing modalities of Ayurveda of aromas, gems, mantras, and rituals. The use of affirmations goes along with prayer. Affirmations can be employed to emphasize our relationship with the divine or our own inner healing powers. Many people suffer from negative thoughts about themselve s, particula rly vata types who Yet affirmations should lead to action and not substitute for it. For example, to do anything in life, like climbing a moun­ tain, requires a belief that one can do it and a positive intention Meditation and the Mind 291 to make the effort. But one still has to climb the mountain and cannot use the affirmation as an excuse for inaction. Affirmations should be ways of attuning our will to the divine will and to our higher purpose in life that we follow with our behavior. Visualization goes along with prayer and meditation. We can visualize the healed or improved condition that we wish to achieve, like visualizing the lungs clear and open and full of energy for one suffering from chronic congestion. We can di­ rect prana or healing energy to those who are sick or to the parts of our own body that need improveme nt. Such visualiza­ tions may employ certain colors and mantras or be directed along with the breath. Visualizations can also be of deities or beautiful scenes in nature to clear the mental field. Samhalpa means will and motivation. It is the most impor­ tant activity of the mind on all levels which is always engaged in the projection of intentions. We are the result of our samkalpas, much like the old proverb : \"As a man wishes in his heart, so is he.\" We create ourselves and our karma through our samkalpas or intentions at a heart level. Samkalpa is the main mental ac­ Ayurveda cultivates the will or samkalpa of healing. Whatever action we do should be preceded by a samkalpa or statement Samkalpa is like a plan or a strategy. We do something in a certain way to arrive at a certain goal. The result that we gain tells 292 Yoga and Ayurveda us the nature and the value of our action. No action is done without the seeking of some sort of result. This result depends upon the intention behind the action, not simply the externali­ ties of what we do. Higher or spiritual actions seek a result that the alleviation of suffering for all beings. Lower actions reflect ego desires to get what we want; to accomplish, achieve or gain for ourselves in some way or another. Spiritual samkalpas direct us without and bind us further to the external world. Samkalpa implies not only developing our own will but also allying our will with the forces that can help it achieve its aim. Therefore it involves a seeking of help, blessings or gUid­ ance. Samkalpas are generally projected as various affirmations Yogic samkalpas are spiritually based. They consist of the intention that one will perform various yogic practices in order to grow spiritually and advance the spiritual cause in the world. \"OM! I will perform the follOwing yogic practices as an offering to the Divine Beloved. May all the divine powers \"OM! I will perform the follOwing meditations to gain knowledge of God and the higher Self. May God and the \"OM! I will perform the follOwing actions as a serVice to God and to living beings in order to help alleviate suffering!\" Meditation and the Mind 293 Ayurveda uses samkalpa as a tool for healing. All healing practices should begin with the proper intention in both the patient and the therapist. The appropriate samkalpa sets the stage for healing processes to function and creates clarity in both the patient and the therapist as to the results that are being sought. \"OM! I seek to heal myself through natural and spiritual methods in order to create optimal health and vitality to develop my spiritual life and fulfill my dharma for the \"OM! I seek to aid in the healing of this patient through natural and spiritual methods in order to alleviate their suffering and help awaken human beings to their true Meditation is a way of life that rests on certain procedures.

Silently observe the mind and let it empty itself out.

This is largely a personal matter and may be conditioned by one's religious background, so it is generally not something for the ayurvedic therapist to decide. Human beings should worship the divine in whatever form appeals to their inmost heart. Anything less is spiritual Hindu deities have specific ayurvedic correspondences. For stacles, can be used to increase kapha and ojas. Hanuman, who has the form of a monkey and is born of the Wind, promotes prana and controls vata. Skanda, the divine child, warrior and The Goddess Kali, who controls death and destruction, can ening diseases. The God Shiva, who rules over the subcon­ scious and the superconscio us, helps us overcome fear, anxiety and trauma. The avatar Rama protects children from harm. There Another important form of devotional worship is the plan­ etary deities, the cosmic powers behind the forces of time and karma. This is done from the standpoint of Vedic astrology. watery planets like the Moon, Venus and Jupiter are good for increasing kapha, ojas and the dhatus. Deities of airy planets Passive meditation involves taking the attitude of a witness 296 Yoga and Ayurveda and observing one's thoughts. Or it may consist of holding to a state of receptivity, opening up to the divine presence or the void. Passive meditation generally begins with external objects, like a ghee lamp or something in nature like a tree or clouds in the sky, then focuses gradually inward on the body, senses, prana, emotions, thought, ego and ultimately the higher Self or Active meditation involves some form of inquiry like \"Who am P\" or seeking one's true nature. This involves tracing the I­ thought back to its origin in pure consciousness. It has been explained in the works of Ramana Maharshi and other teachers of Advaita Vedanta, as well as in traditional Advaitic texts like the Yoga Vasishta or the works of Shankaracharya. It requires seeking the Self behind the body, breath, senses, mind or what­ ever we are observing. It is an extension of ayurvedic counsel­ ing techniques, helping us understand the workings of the body One should have a special room for meditation, containing an altar, special pictures or holy books, and decorated so as to have a spiritual energy. The room should be well ventilated and have natural light. An office or study room can be used if nec­ One should have a comfortable seat or chair for medita­ tion. A meditation rug or cushion made of wool or silk is help­ ful. For meditation, one should sit facing east or north. One can sprinkle a little water around the seat along with reciting a simple mantra like OM before one meditates to purify the seat. Meditation and the Mind 297 Perform a short ritual before meditation like offering a fra­ placed before a statue or picture of a deity or guru or simply offered to the divine in whatever way one wishes. Such a ritual cleanses the psychic air and prepares the room for meditation. One can also ring a bell or do some chant or prayer. A mala or rosary should be used for counting mantras. Rudraksha is good for increasing tejas and for worship of Lord Shiva. Crystal is good for worshipping the Goddess. Tulsi beads or sixteen mantras per bead to make the counting easier.

      "description": "Meditation is also better during the waxing moon. One can consult a Vedic astrologer for favorable times for meditation both during the year and according to the periods of one's life, particularly if one wants to begin intense meditational practices. The best time of the day for meditation is early morning before dawn, the hour of Brahman. Sunrise and sunset are other good periods. Many people find sunset to be the best because by that time of the day the main work is done and one can look within. These are mainly vata times, in which vata and its related systems like the mind and prana can be more easily worked upon. Immediately before sleep is another important Meditation in the morning should be followed by physical exercise like yoga asanas, walking or mild aerobic exercises. Then tea and a light meal can be taken. However, if a person mucus, as in the case of sinus allergies, then exercise and pranayama may be necessary first to dispell the inertia. Other­ wise the mind and brain may be too dull or congested for meditation. Vatas may feel too tired to get up early for medita­ tion. In this case they should try to compensate by going to bed earlier and taking a nap in the afternoon. Pittas like to be night people but can discipline themselves to arise earlier if they make the effort. For people who have trouble staying awake during morning meditation, a morning walk can be helpful first or a walking meditation instead of a sitting meditation. In the evening, meditation should be followed by sleep, so that a deep sleep can ensue. In the evening there should be no sensory distraction, like television, immediately before medita­ tion or after it. One should avoid disturbing the mind after Meditation and the Mind 299 evening meditation or one will lose much of the benefit of the practice. Meditation should not be done immediately after eat­ Meditation should consist of about fifteen minutes of pranayama, fifteen minutes of mantra, and then fifteen minutes of silent or devotional meditation as a minimum. It should be done at least twice a day, morning and evening. After one has mastered this as a continual practice, the length of meditation can be increased and it can be done three times a day or more. The most important thing is consistency of practice. It is better to meditate a little every day than to do a lot of medita­ tion on an irregular basis. Occasional meditation intensives or retreats are helpful but should be followed up by consistent Ayurvedic doctors often perform a meditation upon Lord Dhanvantari before treatment or before classes. One can use the Others do a meditation on Lord Ganesha , which removes One can also meditate upon one's ishta devata or chosen Ayurvedic practitioners often perform prayers or mantras in the presence of the patient as part of the treatment. The patients may be encouraged to join in the process. In addition it is best for practitioners to do some silent meditation before seeing cli­ Vata types should practice meditation in order to calm their restless minds and nerves and to relieve their inherent tendency to fear and anxiety. Meditation can take them very far in over­ coming their main problem in life a hypersensi tive and hy­ peractive mind and vital force. Meditation helps them sleep, alleviates their nervous digestion, and strengthens their immune However, vatas must be careful because meditation done wrongly can be ungrounding and quickly spaces them out. They can get lost in their thoughts or their prana can become dis­ turbed. For this reason, vatas should first learn the art of con­ centration so that their minds do not wander. It is better for them to do mantra or visualization rather than try to empty their minds, which may already have too much of the ether Yet vata types should not try to stop or suppress their natu­ ral mental activity either. They should let their minds move freely and naturally while seeking the deeper truth of life. They must learn to harness their abundant mental energy for medita­ tion, which for them should be like the flight of an eagle. They Vata people should first make sure that they are sitting com­ fortably and that their body and joints are at ease. They should do some relaxation exercises to release tension before sitting, or Meditation and the Mind 301 talk a walk first. Vata people have trouble sitting still and without some as ana practice may not last long in the same posture. Vatas suffer from low energy that weakens concentration. They should deepen their breath so that they have sufficient prana for meditation. Pranayama may initially make vatas feel tired because it reduces the hyperacti vity of vata .. If this occurs they should do a little rapid or vigorous deep breathing until their mental clarity returns. Yet vatas should never be forceful For visualizati on, vata people should use earthy, watery and fiery images like a mountain, a lake or the ocean, flowers like a color therapy can be used, like the colors gold or saffron. This they should do for a few minutes to clear their mental field. Vatas should affirm the basic peace and fearlessness of their higher nature and learn to let go of worry and anxiety. They should have faith in some form of God or great teacher to take care of them on the inner planes. They should call upon the protection of the forms of God and the Goddess and the gurus to help them with problems that they cannot solve of their Vatas should repeat such mantras during the meditation period and also do them during the day, particular ly when vata ap­ pears to be getting out of balance. Often it is better if these mantras are muttered in a low voice, which keeps vata types Vata types require benefic forms of divine energy, particular ly forms of the divine Father and Mother, the parental relationship 302 Yoga and Ayurveda that is calming, supporting and nourishing. Protective forms of the Divine Mother like Durga and Tara are especially good. Ben­ efic forms of the Divine Father like Shiva as the Lord of Yogis or Vishnu as the avatar and savior Rama are similarly very helpful. Ganesh can be very grounding. Hanuman in particular gives the power of prana and represents higher vata characteristics. Vata people should meditate upon the eternal and immu­ table nature of truth in order to slow down their thoughts. They require contact with dharma or universal law in order to give support to their restless minds. They must learn to contact the changeless and immortal Self within the heart or the still and silent expanse of pure Being. Vatas need to become stabi­ lized in their inner nature and not worry about the fluctuations of the external world. They must turn within and forget the Pitta people need to meditate in order to release their anger and aggression and let go of their generally willful and control­ ling approach to life. Pittas usually have good concentration and can meditate more easily than other types. Mantra and medi­ tation can be a good way for them to focus their strong mental energy in a positive manner, directing their attention toward an Pittas should be careful to meditate peacefully and not try to turn meditation into another form of achievement or con­ quest. For them meditation can become too focused and even tension. They must learn to expand their mind and heart in Meditation and the Mind 303 meditation, using their inherent light to reveal the truth. Medi­ tation should leave them feeling cool and calm in mind and heart, like gentle waves moving across a lake in the moonlight . Pitta people should first make sure to be cool and relaxed in their meditation posture. They should not do any strenuous exercise before meditation or work up a sweat. They should do pranayama that is cooling, emphasizing lunar breathing or breath­ ing through the left nostril. Shitali can also be done. They should release their internal heat through the breath before meditation. forest, a lake or the ocean, rain clouds, the deep blue sky, flow­ therapy can be used, like the colors white, dark blue or emer­ Pitta people should do affinnations increasing forgiveness, compassion and love and surrendering anger.

While pittas may incline to more fiery or wrathful forms, they should be careful with them as Meditating upon God as the divine friend or divine beloved is another way. Pittas can transform their passion into devotion but should keep that devotion receptive and peaceful. They can take the attitude of a warrior for the divine but must be cautious not to use this as a way of promoting more aggressive energy. Pitta types can be very critical in their minds, caught in their own opinions and judgments that prevents them from getting beyond the field of thought. They should use this as power to inquire into the nature of consciousness and contact the higher Self beyond the mind, developing the art of dis­ Pittas benefit from meditating upon infinite space beyond all the limitations of the critical mind. If they can direct their concentration in a beneficial way they can discover the light within the heart, which is like the moon and is beyond the heat and agitation of the outer mind. Silence and receptivity of Kapha types require meditation in order to let go of emo­ tional attachment and to counter mental stagnation and leth­ argy. Meditation helps them release possessiveness and heavi­ ness into the space of consciousness, in which alone is true happiness and abundance. Kaphas may require encouragement, ten do better meditating in a group. For them a more disci­ plined approach to meditation is required, even if it does not Kaphas are likely to fall asleep during meditation. For this reason they should do more active forms of meditation, includ­ ing mantra and pranayama, or combine meditation with activ­ ity. They are also prone to fall into their imagination or day­ dream. They need to cultivate a wakeful attention to counter Kapha people should first do some physical exercise to open their circulation and dispel stagnation before taking a seating posture. This may require some mild aerobic exercise but not too strenuous as to disturb the mind. Walking meditation is They should also do some vigorous pranayama, emphasiz­ nostril breathing to move their energy. Then they can proceed with a more calm type of pranayama. They should combine meditation with periods of pranayama to keep their energy Kapha people should focus on images which increase the fire, air and ether elements, like the sun, the wind moving through therapy can also be used, like gold, blue and orange . Kapha people need to affirm the detachment of their higher nature. Such affirmations like \"In my true Self I am indepen­ dent, free and of the nature of space\" are useful for them. They should also seek to develop their kapha energy of love by di­ recting thoughts of love and care for all creatures. 306 Yoga and Ayurveda They should do stimulating and clearing mantras, first out loud for a few minutes, then repeating them with the breath. Kaphas are highly lOving people and benefit by cultivating a devotional relationship with the divine. Faith and surrender are usually easy for them. They are open to many forms of devotional worship. Loving forms of the divine are most attrac­ tive to them. However, they may require more stimulating or wrathful forms of the God and Goddess to motivate them, like Kaphas should avoid getting caught in excessive emo­ This requires purity of heart and mind, using devotion to re­ duce attachment, release emotion, and lighten the human per­ sonality and ego . They should also avoid getting attached to the outer forms of devotion. They must learn to contact the infinite and formless through the forms that they use. Kapha people need to learn the formlessness and infinity of reality in order to release their attachment to form and limita­ tion. They are particularly good at meditating upon the eternal, immutable aspect of truth. They can cultivate unchanging peace Meditation upon the void is particularly good for them be­ cause it increases space in the mind. It can be combined with meditation upon the inner light, bringing more fire into their minds. Inquiry forms of meditation may be hard for them be­ cause their minds like to rest in a comfortable state. This is not always good, however, as they can confuse such a contented state of mind with higher truth. Kaphas must learn to rouse Meditation and the Mind 307 their attention to always go further. They should not rest con­ tent until they have gone beyond their personal limitations. They should view meditation like climbing a series of mountain peaks along a great journey, not stopping along the way, no matter Ayurveda and yoga culminate in the art of meditation.

It culminates in a sharp point that pen­ etrates into the infinite, but it rests on a broad base that goes May this wisdom help you in all aspects of your life and he Vedas are the great mantric scriptures set forth by Himalayan rishis, yogis and sages who lived many thou sands of years ago at the reputed beginning of this World Age or yuga, at the dawn of human history. They are said to manifest the wisdom of the cosmic mind that is the origin and support of the universe and the foundation of natural law. The four Vedas were passed down through long oral and written traditions dating from before the time of Krishna, four or five The Vedas present the broader system of Self and cosmic knowledge of which yoga and Ayurveda are specific manifesta­ tions. Both Ayurveda and yoga arose as Vedic schools, taught by lineages of Vedic seers, projecting Vedic knowledge into specific practical forms. Both look back upon Vedic texts for their au­ thority. They follow the Vedic vision into their respective fields The Vedas are primarily three in number and each relates to an important practice of yoga and Ayurveda. The three Vedas reflect a mantric approach that comprehends all aspects of life. They set forth the Vedic ritual, yajna or fire sacrifice, which mirrors the process of cosmic creation. Inwardly it is a yoga and the perceived within us. This general Vedic yajna uncovers all the powers of the universe and can be used to realize all the goals of life fram health to liberation. A fourth Veda, the Atharva Veda, provides mantras for specific topics, including personal The Vedic yajna is a healing process aimed at restoring to wholeness the divine consciousness that has entered into us and become fragmented through the mind, body and senses. The purpose of the Vedic yajna is to heal or put back together the purusha or cosmic being that has sacrificed itself to become the world. This reintegration of the Creator and creation, or God and the soul, is the foundation of yoga as well, which means union. Ayurveda arises out of this Vedic urge not merely for personal healing but for healing the divine consciousness The existent Vedic texts are vehicles of a deeper cosmic wisdom that is woven into all aspects of life. In this regard the Vedas are infinite and eternal. They are inherent in the cosmic Mind and manifest along with every cycle of creation as the vibrations of the divine Word through which the universe comes into being. Our soul and its creative forces work through a The Vedic mantras reflect the energy of life. They are said to entire movement of cosmic energy. As vehicles for the cosmic prana, the Vedas possess tremendous vitality and healing power. Prana itself creates language , as speech itself arises from the breath. This creative word holds the seed or archetypal forms of creation that the Vedas portray. Through the Vedas, therefore, we gain access to the very powers of creation that can change There are two main parts of the Vedas. First is the mantra ond is the commentary portion, which itself consists of three parts the Brahmanas, Aranyahas and Upanishads making up a total of four sections. The Brahmanas deal with the details and collective. The Aranyahas are similar but have a more inter­ nal nature, providing themes for meditation and ascetic prac­ tices The Upanishads are predominantly philosophical in nature and provide a summary of Vedic insights and knowledge . Yet the distinction between Brahmanas and Upanishads is only a matter of degree. The Brahmanas teach much spiritual wisdom tices of various types. The Upanishads are the basis of Vedanta, yoga and the later spiritual and philosophical disciplines that Out of the Vedas arose six schools of philosophy, shad darshanas , which literally means six ways of seeing or insight. These were deSigned to show the logical, metaphysical and cosmolog ical implications with the Vedic mantras. Classical yoga as expounded by Patanjali in the Yoga Sutras is one of these six 312 Yoga and Ayurveda schools of Vedic philosoph y. Patanjali himself was said to be in the line of the great yogi and Vedic sage Yajnavalkya, one of the seers of the Yajur Veda and Brihadaranyaha Upanishad, and Patanjali was said to be a teacher of the Sama Veda as well.

Samkhya prOvides the background philosophy and cosmol­ ogy both for yoga and Ayurveda, as already noted earlier in the book. It has a scientific view, examining both internal and ex­ ternal reality. The Samkhya system outlines the tattvas or cos­ mic principles that yogic practice seeks to realize. However, there is a slight difference between Samkhya and yoga. Samkhya is more concerned with knowledge of the tattvas is concerned more with purification of the corresponding tattvas within us. Yoga prepares us for the knowledge of Samkhya because only when a tattva is purified can we understand it. Yoga adds a theistic view to Samkhya and could be called a theistic form of Samkhya. Yet the approach of yoga is more practical and so more of a technolog y than a philosophy and can be used with late Vedic texts, like the Bhagavad Gita of Sri Krishna, which is also said to be a yogic scripture . Yoga is commonly mentioned in the Upanishads, particularly the Prashna, Katha and Svestasvatara. References to Yoga can be found in all the Vedas going back to the Rig Veda itself.42 Many great modern yogis like Sri Aurobindo , Ganapati Muni or Paramahamsa Yogananda The ritualistic school, Purva Mimamsa , emphasizes proper performance of rituals for both individual and social welfare, using special prayers and offerings to link us with the benefi­ cent forces of the universe . These rituals are good for purifying body and mind and prepare us for meditation. This is the field The term Vedanta is used specifically for the Uttara Mimamsa school, which is the most concerned of the six systems with cal school discusses the nature of God, the soul, the Absolute and their relationsh ip. There are several schools of Vedanta, which became in time the most important and extensive of the soul to be manifestations of the Absolute , which constitutes edge, such as made popular today through the teachings of the eternally related. It teaches devotion to God and the subordina­ tion of the soul to His grace. It emphasizes bhakti yoga or the follow this line, including the Krishna movement of Prabhupada. important. It is devotional and Vaishnava in nature like the dualistic school. It has a special connection to yoga. Krishnamacha rya of Madras is the guru of many yoga teachers famous in the West, such as B.KS. Iyengar, Pattabhi jois or Yoga is closely aligned with Vedanta of some sort. Most of the original yoga teachers who came to the West Swami Vivekananda, Rama Tirtha, Paramahamsa Yogananda, Swami Rama, or the many disCiples of Swami Shivananda taught",

      "description": "Vedanta is close to Samkhya, and in later India took over much of the place of Samkhya, whose main teachings it adapted. Samkhya itself was originally a Vedic system, with its own com­ mentaries on Vedantic texts. Yet there is a slight difference be­ Samkhya and Vedanta are both concerned with knowledge of the tattvas. However, Samkhya is concerned with knowledge of all the tattvas leading to the purusha or individual soul. Vedanta, particularly in the advaitic school, is aimed mainly at the highest tattva, and has less concern with the lower tattvas. cerned mainly with Ishvara tattva or the Creator, which is not a To use Sanskrit terms: Samkhya is concerned with tattva vichara or inquiry into the nature of the tattvas. Advaita Vedanta involves Atma tattva vichara, inquiry into the Self or the high­ est tattva. Dualistic Vedanta's main concern is Ishvara tattva vichara, inquiry into the nature of God and our relationship Yoga is concerned with tattva shuddhi, which means not only purification of the tattvas but research into them. Yoga, in purifying the tattvas, allows for inquiry into them to proceed, which cannot occur when mind and body are in an impure condition. The proper practice of yoga in all of its eight limbs up to samadhi, therefore, provides us the aptitude to pursue Samkhya and Vedanta. For this reason many Vedantins require that their students first gain proficiency in yoga so that they have the right training to proceed on their knowledge quest. Yet yoga in some form is part of all six schools, which are integral parts of the same Vedic darshana or way of seeing. Yoga provides the practical foundation for the insights that the other systems seek to develop preparing body, prana and mind to become tools of inner inquiry In this regard yoga is probably the most universal of the six systems and is the main link be­ tween them. Ayurveda provides the foundation of right living for yoga and for all the six systems, whose world view and practices it shares, so it also is common to all the six systems. Yoga and Ayurveda, at least to some degree, were adopted Sufi teachers have used various insights and methods of Ayurveda and yoga. Many connections are through tantra, which employs aspects of yoga and Ayurveda and has Hindu and Buddhist forms. Tibetan medicine , for example, is predominantly ayurvedic. 316 Yoga and Ayurveda The Upavedas supplement the Vedas with more specific applications of Vedic teachings into the cultural field. Ayurveda arose as a secondary Veda or Upaveda generally connected with the Atharva Veda. This is because the Atharva Veda first pre­ sents specific mantras and methods for treating various diseases. However, Ayurveda is connected with the other Vedas, which It has a close connection with Yajur Veda which describes the Vedic ritual aimed at healing both the Cosmic Being and the 3. Sthapatya Veda architectu re, sculpture and geomancy Ayurveda is closely connected with all the Upavedas. It re­ lies upon Dhanur Veda or the martial arts for exercise recom­ mendations and styles of massage and body work, particularly the treatment of the marmas or sensitive points on the body The marmas are mainly described in Dhanur Veda. Many yoga Ayurveda employs Gandharva Veda for its subtle therapies of music and art, which are very important in healing both mind and body Yogas of music and sound develop out of Sthapatya Veda, more commonly called Vastu, shows the right design of structures to bring in wholesome earth and spa­ tial energies. This is essential for the proper orientation and construction of clinics, hospitals, and healing rooms. Some people The Vedic Connection 317 may suffer from disease mainly due to the fact that the wrong construction of their houses exposes them to harmful directional forces. For this reason, many ayurvedic doctors will question patients on how their house is situated as part of their diagnosis . Yoga uses Vastu for the orientation of temples, ashrams and meditation rooms. For example, the yogic recommendation to meditate facing east or north reflects the considerations of Vastu. There are six Vedangas or limbs of the Vedas. These are closer to the Vedas than the Upavedas, being part of the Vedas Of the six vedangas , jyotish or Vedic astrology is the most importan t. For Ayurveda it helps determine the basic health potential of the person, their disease tendency and possibility of recovery. This is particularly important for patients suffering from severe illnesses and for illnesses that are not responding to normal treatment measures. Vedic astrology is also used for the timing of treatment and for preparing medicines. Even the right therapy done at the wrong time may not bring good re­ sults. Astrology helps us understand psychological problems, which are often evident from the birth chart. It is useful in ayurvedic therapies, particularly for showing what gems are best Vedic astrolog y is helpful in yoga for determining individual spiritual potential, for the timing of yogic practices and, particu­ larly, for mantra initiation. An examination of the birth chart is important either for ayurvedic or yogic concerns and is an inte­ gral part of a Vedic approach to life. For this reason many ayurvedic and yoga practitioners study jyotish or at least make sure to have access to a good astrologer to consult with as needed. Four of the six vedangas deal with language . They are the basis of the Sanskrit language and its precise terminolog y for both yoga and Ayurveda. They are part of the path of mantra yoga, which is very important in both yoga and Ayurveda. Ayurveda uses mantra as the main tool for healing the mind. Yoga uses it as the main tool for purifying the mind and un­ folding its inner powers and faculties. Mantra is the most im­ portant tool of yoga, Ayurveda and jyotish and the foundation In summary, yoga arose as the application of Vedic wisdom ing and right living. Both systems are best understood in a Vedic context and help us understand the principles of Vedic livingH Yoga provides the means for purification of the mind tation in space. ]yotish gives us purification from negative plan­ combining Ayurveda, yoga and related diSciplines we have a tremendous resource that can transform both ourselves and our planet if we apply it in our daily lives. This is one of the keys to higher evolution in humanity, a subject that requires much more attention in this age of crisis and transition. ApPENDIX 2",
